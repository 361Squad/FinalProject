220,Half-Life 2,"1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named ""Best PC Game Ever"" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.
		NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.
		The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.
		The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source®, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in:

Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial ""muscles,"" human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence.
Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy.
Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story® and Monster's, Inc.®, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game.
AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.

This is an extremely difficult task since launching an attack on the enemy exposes the positions of your own Ground Silos, Subs and Bombers the moment they launch nuclear weapons, making you extremely vulnerable and exposed to a crushing counter-attack.

12810,Overlord II,"Overlord II, sequel to the critically acclaimed cult hit, sees the return of the chaotic Minions and their new Dark Master. Bigger, badder and more beautifully destructive, Overlord 2 has a Glorious Empire to smash, a massive Netherworld to revive, Minion mounts to mobilize, a trio of mistresses to woo, War Machines to crush opposition and lots of cute creatures to, err... murder (and a mini-map) What sort of stuff will I get to kill? Your main source of victims will come from the brave and highly flammable ranks of the Glorious Empire, a sinister regime that gained power after the fall of the previous Overlord. You'll be hacking your way through entire battalions at a time, but to keep the blood on your sword varied we've also thrown a few Yetis, Elves, villagers and annoyingly cute indigenous species into the mix, just to name but a few. Don't say we never do anything for you. I've always wanted to enslave the human race, is this the game for me? You've come to the right place! With the Domination style Overlord humanity, can become your plaything. Village by village, you'll reap the benefits of an unwilling workforce as you drive the Glorious Empire from your lands. I'm more of a ""watch the world burn"" kind of guy, can I still get my rocks off? We've got your pleasure, sir. With the Destruction style Overlord you can ravage the land like a moody Tsunami; razing cities, forests and Imperial camps to the ground just because they looked at you funny. What can my minions do? Minions are angry little Swiss army knives of pain: They can ride into battle on wolves and other magical creatures, loot the best weapons from stomped enemies, pillage houses for treasure, operate fearsome war machines, infiltrate enemy camps and polish your armour so thoroughly you'll blind passing wildlife. What types of Minions can I rule? This new batch of minions is smarter, faster, deadlier and wittier than the sorry sacks of skin you used to rule. Minions now come in four fantastic flavours: Browns are brutal brawlers that solve their problems with teeth and fists. Reds are the surly artillery who love to play catch, as long as it's with fireballs. Greens are the stealthy assassins. Silent and deadly, like a fart on legs. Blues are no use in a fight but can resurrect fellow Minions who've tried to stop a sword with their face. ",936479,Triumph Studios,Codemasters,GenreRPG,TagRPG*TagFantasy*TagVillainProtagonist*TagFunny*TagSingleplayer*TagAction*TagThirdPerson*TagComedy*TagActionRPG*TagMagic*TagStrategy*TagAdventure*TagDarkHumor*TagAction-Adventure*TagOpenWorld*TagPuzzle*TagAtmospheric*TagDarkFantasy*TagMultiplayer,65

A horde of enemies is invading, and it's up to the player to stop them by strategically building fortification towers around their base.  Beautiful environments, spectacular effects, and a dynamic, engaging soundtrack bring the world to life.  The controls are intuitive and the gameplay is deep — the special attacks and properties of each tower work together to provide many ways to succeed.                     High Replayability There are approximately 8 hours of gameplay in the main storyline, and many hours of play in challenge modes that give players unique starting conditions and objectives.  Each game level is very replayable, and can be solved in many different ways, with increasing rewards for improved efficiency.                      Wide Variety of Enemies Over the course of the game, players battle 15 different enemy types that become increasingly stronger, and employ a variety of strategies in an attempt to bypass the player's defenses.  As the levels progress, the enemies become tougher and more difficult to defeat.                     20 Unique Levels  Defense Grid: The Awakening has 20 unique environments, each with a different placement of roads, tower build locations, and open areas to plan a strategy around.                      Numerous Tower Options and Upgrades There are 10 different tower types with 3 levels of capability each.  Each tower has unique trade offs that affect ideal placement, such as line-of-sight attack or ballistic trajectory fire.  Some towers improve other nearby towers, and some are ideal at specific locations, such as a rear guard tower that unleashes a devastating attack.

20510,S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky,"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky is set in 2011, one year prior to the events of the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game.

A group of stalkers, for the first time, reaches the very heart of the Zone-the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant-and triggers a cataclysm on the brink of a catastrophe. An immense blast of anomalous energy transforms the Zone: the once reliable and relatively safe roads are no longer so, the landscape is wiped clean by outbursts of anomalies, and previously unknown areas appear on the Zone map. Stalkers and expeditions perish or end up isolated within the lost territories.

With the anomalous activity at its maximum, the unstable Zone continues to tremor with outbursts. The transformation of the Zone map destabilizes the fragile balance of forces in the Zone. Hostilities for the new territories, artifact fields and spheres of influence flare up among groups. There are no more old enemies or friends - now, everyone watches out only for themselves. The Factions War has begun.

The protagonist is a mercenary who appeared at the edge of the opposition between stalker factions, Strelok and even the Zone itself. The main character experiences the key role in the events that led to the creation of the Zone right up to the point from which the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game begins.

What new challenges await stalkers within the depths of the new zone? Why do anomalous outbursts continue to rattle the Zone, and what can be done to stop them? Which faction will take the upper hand in the Factions War? These and many other questions will be answered in the official prequel - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky.",521381,GSC Game World,GSC World Publishing,GenreAction*GenreRPG,TagOpenWorld*TagAtmospheric*TagPost-apocalyptic*TagFPS*TagAction*TagSurvival*TagRPG*TagShooter*TagSingleplayer*TagFirst-Person*TagSurvivalHorror*TagClassic*TagSci-fi*TagModdable*TagHorror*TagAdventure*TagZombies*TagMultiplayer*TagInventoryManagement*TagSandbox,60

24010,Train Simulator 2016,"  Train Simulator 2016 is the biggest package of exclusive content we have ever delivered in a Train Simulator. Here’s a complete list of what’s included: Riviera Line in the Fifties   Feel the pressure of steam as you travel back to the time of Green and Gold, from the powerful Kings to the romantic Castles, the heavy working Halls, the goods-carrying Granges and the famous Pannier Tanks across the Riviera Line set in the nostalgic 1950s. Relive the time when steam reigned on all services from local freight to coastline express, whether you perform perfectly alone or need some assistance to get to your destination. Keep an eye on those signals, they can be easy to lose in the cold western fog.   Sherman Hill   Experience the power of the fuel-hungry Big Blows across the challenging Sherman Hill as you haul hundreds upon hundreds of tons, putting that 8500 horsepower turbine through its paces, or opt for some conventional traction in the form of ES44ACs, drive in more comfortable conditions in the wide cab of the SD70M, or maybe in the classic SD40-2s. Watch out though, winter can be brutal even for the most powerful of locos.   West Rhine Railway: Cologne – Koblenz   Control the Genesis of modern Electro-motive traction as you haul heavy freight across the stunning West Rhine Railway in the DB BR 155 ‘Electric Container’, take passengers on their scenic commute with the DB BR 146 or shunt together a train to be taken far away with the DB BR 294. Be mindful of the weather, heavy rain can take even the best drivers by surprise.   Railfan Mode   Enjoy the power and finesse of the railway away from the drivers cab with railfan mode, watch from the platform, track side or stand on a bridge and take in the excitement without worrying about the journey, just make sure you’re ready to take some shots, you never know what you might see out on the tracks!   Steam Edition: Norfolk Southern Coal District   Struggle through the beautifully scenic Mon Line as you haul mile long coal trains through the winding curves and streets of Pennsylvania. Collect coal as you drive your ES44AC slowly under the loading facilities and prepare for the run to the other end of the line. While being relatively level, the sharp river-side turns and the slow speeds as you cut right through a town will not be mastered easily.   TS Academy   New to driving trains? Not to worry! With the newly updated TS Academy you can learn all that you need to beat the extreme, from basic passenger operations to freight terminals that require pin-point accuracy or nailing those complex and unique signalling systems. TS academy is the best way to learn or remember how to control every type of train.   Driver Assist   Have you mastered driving diesel and electric locos, but struggled to control steam? Found it too complicated to drive or understand? Now you can master these delicate engines with our all new driving assist! Driver assist will provide you with real time information based on the locomotives performance and handling, it will guide you through driving a steam loco by highlighting the controls in cab and telling you how to move them to get the best out of the engine. Driver Assist is featured on all the steam locomotives included with the Riviera Line in the Fifties route and can be turned on and off at will.   Train Simulator 2016 is out now and features the 60 Mile Sherman Hill route with UP Gas Turbine, ES44AC, SD70, SD40 and SW10 locomotives and freight wagons.

24870,Need for Speed: Shift,"Need for Speed™ SHIFT is an award-winning authentic racing game that combines the true driver’s experience with real-world physics, pixel-perfect car models, and a wide range of authentic race tracks. Need for Speed SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars. Players are thrust into the loud, visceral, intense, athletic experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver’s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. Need for Speed SHIFT features an accurate, accessible physics-based driving model that allows you to feel every impact, every change of track surface and every last bit of grip as you push yourself to the edge. True Driver's Experience - A variety of visual cues delivers the true driver’s experience including a three-dimensional HUD that mimics driver head movement, inertia and G-forces. The depth of field also adjusts based on the speed of the car; so when the car is traveling at high speeds the perspective will shift to the distance putting the car/cockpit out of focus. Driver Profile - What kind of driver are you? Driver profile tracks the player’s evolution as a race driver from event to event. This system is made up of a driver’s personality on the track, their success rate and any profile points and badges accrued all of which work together to create a tailor-made career and game play experience. Driver profile is pervasive throughout all modes: career and online. Dynamic Crash Effect - When the player hits a static object or opponent car, the player will feel like they are 'taking damage'. A combination of visual and audio effects will leave the player disoriented and briefly disrupt the race. Total Customization - Need for Speed SHIFT features a comprehensive customization option that lets the player tailor every aspect of the cars performance and styling. Go under the hood to upgrade and tune your vehicle to increase its performance. The visual customization system allows players to personalize both the exterior and trick out the interior to reflect their individual style and preferences. Photo-Realistic Cars and Tracks - Nearly 70 licensed cars are available including the Pagani Zonda F, Audi RS4, and Porsche 911 GT3 RSR. There is also over 15 real-world locations like Willow Springs and Laguna Seca as well as fictional circuits like downtown London and Tokyo.

41500,Torchlight,"Behold Torchlight, a fresh new Action RPG franchise developed by Runic Games. Torchlight is being developed in Seattle by a veteran team composed of the designers and leads of projects like Diablo, Diablo II, Mythos, and Fate. Our team has spent many years honing and evolving this unique style of gameplay.
The adventure is set in the mining settlement of Torchlight, a boomtown founded on the discovery of rich veins of Ember - a rare and mysterious ore with the power to enchant or corrupt all that it contacts.  This corruptive power may have dire consequences however, and players set out into the nearby mountains and depths below to discover the full extent of Ember’s influence on the civilizations that have come before.
Runic Games will initially release Torchlight as a standalone Single Player game, Torchlight will be released in the latter part of 2009 as a download or in box. Following the single player release, work will commence on a fully-featured MMO version.

Single Player Version
Players will choose from among three character classes, and venture from the safety of the town of Torchlight into randomly generated dungeon levels, with a huge variety of creepy monsters, endless variations of loot to find, and quests to complete. The endless randomization ensures a long-lived gameplay experience.

Randomization - Our level layouts are randomly created, so each adventure is unique. Monsters, treasures, puzzles, and items are also different each time you embark on an adventure
					Easy, approachable interface - Torchlight is designed to be easy to play right from the beginning. The intuitive interface gives players easy access to a rich and varied world
					Retirement System - Once characters are sufficiently leveled up, they can “retire” and bestow specific benefits and perks to new characters
					Pets - Players will choose a pet to accompany them. Pets can level up along with the player, and will help in battle, carry items, and perform a variety of helpful services
					Character Classes - Players will create and customize a character from one of three classes available, and choose an animal companion. Through cosmetic choices, skill path decisions, and the treasures they acquire, each character will be custom-tailored and different
					Fishing - Players can take a break from the high-energy pace of adventuring to visit one of the fishing holes and relax and see what they can catch. Fish have interesting benefits for the player and pet, and other rewards can also be discovered
					Included Editor - Runic Games is embracing our modding community by including an editor so our players can create and design their own content
					Steam Cloud - Save your game progress to the Steam Cloud and resume from another computer. However, save games are not cross platform; PC saves will not migrate to Mac and vice-versa.

41800,Gratuitous Space Battles,"Who needs backstory? Who needs resource-gathering? Diplomacy is so last year. Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space battles between huge opposing space fleets.					Gratuitous Space Battles combines the visual appeal of an RTS, with the addictive unit-placement and design gameplay from tower defense games. In GSB, the player does not control individual ships at all during battle. The ships fight to a pre-determined set of orders and formations given to them by you before the battles.					GSB casts you as supreme space admiral, tasked with the design of individual spaceships, and the composition of your fleet, as well as general orders of engagement. This is not a twitch-based real time arcade game like many an RTS, but a game of careful thought, planning and big-picture strategy. Huge space battles can be won or lost depending on just how cleverly you balanced the needs of defensive shielding and armor against the expensive punch of laser cannons and plasma torpedoes.					GSB also features an innovative multiplayer challenge system. You can upload your ultimate fleet to serve as the enemy to other players, and keep track of how many other players have won and lost against your challenge. That way, you will never run out of cunningly designed enemies to battle against! 4 different unlockable player races Over 40 different ship hulls Over 120 spaceship modules Choice of skirmish vs AI, never-ending survival mode or play against other player’s fleets with the online challenge system Play with different rules as each battle has different spatial anomalies to deal with.

45410,Ignite,"Every race is different in Ignite. Each race brings something new as players try to win by using their own tactics.						The score system in Ignite allows for tactics to be used during a race. Gathering score allows the use of nitro in the race and converts to time bonus at the end. So short term usage of nitro can help the players get out of situations ahead of the others but using a lot of nitro and thus score may cost him the game. There are different methods of gathering score (drafting, hitting objects, drifting) and some cars are more suited for a method then the other. Choosing the right car for the preferred method and playing out your strategy will make the player win the game. Key features: Single and multiplayer game: a 35 races long single player campaign played at 7 locations. Multiplayer game up to 5 players. 3 Brand new modes of game play: Race mode: A new twist to the racing genre: Players can gather score and burn it away to get ahead or collect score and jump to the front at the end of the race when it is converted into time bonus.  Knock-Out mode: At the end of each lap, the last player gets knocked out of the race. Those who remain, get a score bonus.  Run-Out mode: Players start with a set amount of score, but it is gradually running out. Players may replenish some of their score with stunts or burn some of it away as nitro but if their score runs down to zero they lose the game. 3 different types of racing cars: The American muscle, the street and the race cars all have a certain feel which requires different driving technique.  Various configuration for each car: All vehicles have different settings which makes them suitable for different races or driving styles. 30 Achievements: A full achievement system to award stunts and special skills and also to teach some of the techniques in the game.  Leaderboard: A worldwide leaderboard for each racetrack. Car damage: cars get damaged which does not influence the handling. Random atmospheres: From sunshiny, to fogy the same racetrack may have a very different feel in two races. ",72027,Nemesys Games,Nemesys Games,GenreRacing,TagRacing,15

203810,Dear Esther,"“A deserted island…a lost man…memories of a fatal crash…a book written by a dying explorer.” Two years in the making, the highly anticipated Indie remake of the cult mod Dear Esther arrives on PC. Dear Esther immerses you in a stunningly realised world, a remote and desolate island somewhere in the outer Hebrides.

What is the significance of the aerial -- What happened on the motorway -- is the island real or imagined -- who is Esther and why has she chosen to summon you here? The answers are out there, on the lost beach, the windswept cliffs and buried in the darkness of the tunnels beneath the island… Or then again, they may just not be, after all… Dear Esther is supported by Indie Fund.Key features: Every play-through a unique experience, with randomly generated audio, visuals and events.Explore Incredible environments that push the Source engine to new levels of beauty.A poetic, semi-randomised story like you've never experienced in a game before.Stunning soundtrack featuring world-class musicians.An uncompromisingly inventive game delivered to the highest AAA standards.SoundtrackJessica Curry's haunting and beautiful soundtrack to Dear Esther, now available on Steam, has been a hit with gamers and critics alike.

A camera might not seem like enough for a puzzle platforming adventure, but this camera is different from most:  It has the ability to capture and remove from the world the very objects that it photographs.  Not only that, but it can also use its powers to paste the photos it took back into the environment!  Everything that the camera captures is perfectly preserved, and when the photos are restored the objects are restored with it.  On top of all of that, this amazing camera can also rotate the photos before they're pasted.  Take a picture of an incoming fireball, rotate it and paste it to send it flying into a wall of heavy boxes to knock it out of the way.

204880,Sins of a Solar Empire®: Rebellion,"The Next Installment to the Award-Winning RTS. While many were hopeful that diplomacy would finally end the war, differing opinions on what should be done, along with the depleted power of the controlling factions, has led to a splintering of the groups involved. The loyalist members of the Trader Emergency Coalition adopt a policy of isolation, focusing on enhanced defenses to ride out the rest of the war. Those who rebel against the coalition take on a purely militant view, coming to the opinion that the only way to bring peace is by ultimately crushing all who oppose them - especially xenos. For the first time in their history, the war creates a schism in the Advent Unity. The loyalists seek to continue their policy of revenge against the Traders, and to assimilate all others to the Unity’s influence. However, others amongst the Advent suspect that a corrupting influence from within has diverted the Unity from its proper destiny. The divide created in the Vasari Empire is less pronounced, but just as severe to their people. With the Vasari now practically frantic to move on to new space, the loyalist faction abandons cooperation and decides to take the resources they need by any means necessary. Having accepted the need to work together, the rebel faction feels that their best chance for survival is to work with the other races and bring them along to flee the approaching enemy. Take the battle for galactic supremacy to its ultimate level in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion – a standalone RT4X game that combines the tactics of real-time strategy with the depth of the 4X genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate).Key features: New Factions:  Decide whether to play as a Loyalist or Rebel – each unlocks new technologies, ships and play styles for each race.New Titan Class Warships:  Mighty titans enter the fray of the war to tip the scales of power.

Strange but true.Special EditionThe Special Edition of Gunpoint includes:The Soundtrack: Includes all of the game's noir-inspired spy music in high quality MP3 format.Developer Commentary: When enabled, you'll find little sprites of Gunpoint's developers on every mission. Talk to us to hear a little about our thinking behind the design (Tom), the art (John), and the music (Ryan).Caution: shooting a developer while he's talking ends his current commentary track. This kills the developer.Exclusive EditionThe Exclusive Edition includes all of the items in the Special Edition plus:The Making Of Gunpoint: a 40-minute video feature taking you through how Gunpoint developed from a one-room test game to what you play today.

For hopefully obvious reasons, we can't give technical support for these.Exclusive Tracks: Bonus pieces produced specially by Gunpoint's composers for this edition, mixing the game's noir style with electronic influences. Since they're not used as background music in the game, our composers took the chance to be more adventurous with these tracks.The Secret Beta Access List (betas may be Windows only): adds an option in the game menu to sign up to our Secret Beta Access List. If and when future Suspicious Developments games are developed, we'll sometimes give secret beta versions only to the members of this list.About the GameGunpoint is a stealth puzzle game that lets you rewire its levels to trick people. You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break into high security buildings and steal sensitive data. To get past security, you'll need to make creative use of your main gadget: the Crosslink. It lets you see how all the security devices in a level are wired up, and then you can just click and drag with the mouse to wire them differently. So you can connect a lightswitch to a trapdoor, then flick it when a guard walks across to make him fall through.Key Features  Rewire levels to work however you want Trick guards into trapping themselves or shooting each other Throw yourself - and others - through plate glass windows Investigate a noir-inspired story of murder and espionage over 20 missions Choose what to tell your clients, including lying to trick them Choose your own playstyle: quick, quiet, non-violent, no living witnesses, or any combination Discover new solutions to levels that no-one else has thought of Buy specialist gadgets to suit how you want to play All story stuff is skippable Hardest puzzles are optional No bosses - everyone dies in one shot, including you",687707,Suspicious Developments,Suspicious Developments,GenreAction*GenreIndie*GenreStrategy,TagStealth*TagIndie*TagPuzzle*TagComedy*Tag2D*TagSingleplayer*TagAction*TagStrategy*TagPlatformer*TagPixelGraphics*TagGreatSoundtrack*TagFunny*TagNoir*TagShort*TagHacking*TagGameMaker*TagLevelEditor*TagAdventure*TagStoryRich*TagSci-fi,98

Fill your dungeons with puzzles, traps, or even totally new items, monsters and environments with custom graphics and audio! Click here to learn more.About the GameLegend of Grimrock is a dungeon crawling role playing game with an oldschool heart but a modern execution. A group of prisoners are sentenced to certain death by exiling them to the secluded Mount Grimrock for vile crimes they may or may not have committed. Unbeknownst to their captors, the mountain is riddled with ancient tunnels, dungeons and tombs built by crumbled civilizations long perished now. If they ever wish to see daylight again and reclaim their freedom the ragtag group of prisoners must form a team and descend through the mountain, level by level.The game brings back the oldschool challenge with highly tactical real-time combat and grid-based movement, devious hidden switches and secrets as well as deadly traps and horrible monsters.

He immediately seized the derelict under his sovereign authority, claiming the rum (and other less important supplies) for his own reserves.   BUT!!  Providentially, the surviving pirates of the pillaging snafu had regrouped and showed up just shortly after the KING set up base, and thus found their long-lost gem in the hands of a belligerent, crown-waving buffoon.

220440,DmC: Devil May Cry,"In this retelling of Dante's origin story which is set against a contemporary backdrop, DmC Devil May Cry™ retains the stylish action, fluid combat and self-assured protagonist that have defined the iconic series but inject a more brutal and visceral edge.  The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or indeed society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. Thanks to his twin brother Vergil, leader of the anti-establishment group called “The Order”, Dante is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement.  For DmC Capcom has teamed up with UK development studio, Ninja Theory, renown for delivering action titles with compelling characters and narrative coupled with high production values. The combination of Ninja Theory’s expertise and Capcom’s unrivalled heritage in producing combat focused action titles will ensure that this latest addition to the over 11-million selling series will remain true to the Devil May Cry DNA so cherished by the fans, while bringing a new level of cinematic quality to the title.Key Features  Survive Limbo - The world of Limbo is a living and breathing entity, out to kill Dante. The world will transform in real-time and try to block off and even kill our hero. Our protagonist will have to master demonic powers to shape Limbo the way he sees fit, while perfecting his angelic skills to traverse this hazardous, twisted world. Who is Dante? – Explore a retelling of Dante’s origin story in a gripping narrative featuring familiar faces from the series alongside all new characters, including Vergil, Dante’s twin brother. Unbridled action – The intense and iconic sword and gun based combat returns with the addition of new Angel and Demon weapons and abilities, all designed to dispatch the demonic spawn back to hell with style and panache. Weapons include: “Rebellion”: Dante’s trusted sword, given by his father Sparda, provides a great mix of combos and attacks, great for sending enemies skyward. “Ebony & Ivory”: These guns are good for keeping enemies at bay, maintaining combos and juggling enemies in the air. “Arbiter”: a demonic axe that can deliver massive blows and break through enemy shields. “Osiris”: an angelic scythe with fast attacks and great for crowd control. “Eryx”: powerful demonic gauntlets that pack enough punch to parry even the strongest attacks and juggle the heaviest enemies.  Retaining the Devil May Cry DNA – Capcom staff, including team members from previous Devil May Cry titles, have been assigned to the project from the outset to ensure DmC is a true addition to the Devil May Cry franchise. Unrivalled production values - Ninja Theory will take advantage of the latest performance capture technology to deliver a level of character design, story-telling and cinematics that perfectly complements DmC’s high-octane combat.",734335,Ninja Theory,Capcom,GenreAction*GenreAdventure,TagAction*TagHackandSlash*TagGreatSoundtrack*TagSpectaclefighter*TagAdventure*TagDemons*TagCharacterActionGame*TagThirdPerson*TagSingleplayer*TagController*TagGore*TagStylized*TagAtmospheric*TagComedy*TagBeat'emup*TagFantasy*TagStoryRich*TagFast-Paced*TagPlatformer*TagAnime,93

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand. Firefight --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork. Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match. Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or ""tug of war"". Ambush --- A high value target (""HVT"") must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate. Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry. Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy. Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective. Elimination --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.Cooperative Game Modes Checkpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way. Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life. Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates. Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates. Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",2507915,New World Interactive,New World Interactive,GenreAction*GenreIndie*GenreStrategy,TagFPS*TagRealistic*TagTactical*TagMultiplayer*TagAction*TagShooter*TagMilitary*TagTeam-Based*TagStrategy*TagCo-op*TagIndie*TagFirst-Person*TagCompetitive*TagOnlineCo-Op*TagSimulation*TagWar*TagPvP*TagAtmospheric*TagSingleplayer*TagAdventure,84

The vivid and wildly creative world of Brütal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It’s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.

Combat
Brütal Legend’s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Brütal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.

A Streaming Open World
Brütal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Brütal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.

Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent
Brütal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970’s classic metal to 1980’s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990’s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.

Multiplayer Mayhem
4v4 ""skirmish"" multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Brütal Legend’s multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).

Music
The music in Brütal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.

It’s all about fun, breakneck racing and over-the-top crashes. Expect epic crashes and tight, neck-to-neck fights over the finish line on run-down racing tracks. Expect proper demolition derbies. Expect brand new ways for metal to bend and the signature once-in-the-lifetime moments that can be achieved only with true-to-life physics simulation. It’s a motorsport, but not just any motorsport. It’s a motorsport with attitude.Unique Racing ExperienceFirst and foremost, we’re building a FUN racing game with PERSONALITY. It’s all about the stuff that really matters: varied tracks, cool cars, and the defining once-in-the-lifetime moments that can be achieved only with true-to-life physics simulation. If you’re familiar with our previous games, you already know what we’re aiming at: exhilarating racing action with sophisticated physics and damage modeling, only this time we’re upping the ante on almost every front. This is the game we envisioned way back in the early 2000s, only re-imagined for today’s technology and gaming standards.Awesome CarsThe cars are old, cheap, banged up, patched together, rusty… just awesome! In short, our cars ooze with STYLE. You won’t find anything like them in other racing games. We’ve got variety, as well: everyone loves the old American heavy-hitters from the muscle car era, but we’re not neglecting the fun little European and Asian cars from the long-gone decades either. The best part is that you’ll be taking them apart and building them back up again in your garage; the career is as much about your garage and your project cars as it is about racing.Exciting EngineOur in-house ROMU engine is a hell-bent beast that's precision-engineered for high-speed, breakneck racing. We have also already implemented fully deformable soft body car damage, meaning that the cars will react to damage in a very tangible, convincing way. While we're focused on action, motorsport authenticity is not forgotten, either. To that end our engine is simulating vehicle dynamics in a very sophisticated fashion. Rolling resistances, casters and slip angles are definitely not ancient Greek to us, and you as the player will be the one benefiting from our expertise.  EARLY ACCESS FEATURESThe current Early Access release contains four playable cars and a number of tracks, showcasing both white-knuckle track racing and explosive demolition derby action with 24 cars that will give you taste of things to come.

Magic has returned to the world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Technology merges with flesh and consciousness. Elves, trolls, orks and dwarves walk among us, while ruthless corporations bleed the world dry. You are a shadowrunner - a mercenary living on the fringes of society, in the shadows of massive corporate arcologies, surviving day-by-day on skill and instinct alone. When the powerful or the desperate need a job done, you get it done... by any means necessary. In the urban sprawl of the Seattle metroplex, the search for a mysterious killer sets you on a trail that leads from the darkest slums to the city’s most powerful megacorps. You will need to tread carefully, enlist the aid of other runners, and master powerful forces of technology and magic in order to emerge from the shadows of Seattle unscathed. The unique cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of Shadowrun has gained a huge cult following since its creation nearly 25 years ago. Now, creator Jordan Weisman returns to the world of Shadowrun, modernizing this classic game setting as a single player, turn-based tactical RPG.Key Features 	Gripping Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With the variety of weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. A successful run requires commanding a team of runners with the right balance of combat, tech, and magical abilities.	Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun Returns’ classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose. Want to start summoning spirits as an ork Shaman and evolve into a cybered-up weapon specialist? Do it!	Engaging 2D/3D Art Style: Shadowrun Returns mixes dynamic 3D characters and lighting with a vibrant, hand-painted environment. Illustrated character portraits bring every conversation to life. Explore a world filled with detail, from the slums of the Redmond Barrens to the extravagant offices of powerful corporations. ",886985,Harebrained Schemes,Harebrained Holdings,GenreAdventure*GenreIndie*GenreRPG*GenreStrategy,TagCyberpunk*TagRPG*TagTurn-Based*TagIsometric*TagSci-fi*TagIndie*TagStrategy*TagSingleplayer*TagTactical*TagKickstarter*TagModdable*TagAdventure*TagCRPG*TagCrowdfunded*TagStoryRich*TagFemaleProtagonist*TagFantasy*TagAtmospheric*TagTurn-BasedStrategy*TagDystopian,77

236510,Takedown: Red Sabre,"TAKEDOWN is a thinking-person’s shooter; brutal, hardcore and deadly - like the real thing. Not for the faint hearted, Takedown requires you to bring your 'A' game - FPS fans looking for an ultra hardcore experience only need apply!The player that takes things slow, aims carefully, and plans their moves right will overcome the player who runs in with guns blazing. Close-quarters battle brings the fight inside, as you would see SWAT teams or SOF units taking down small numbers of dangerous adversaries. Non-linear environments allow for multiple routes and tactics and add replayability.In recent years, shooters have become homogenized. There used to be a wide range of different games to choose, from run-and-gun action titles to slow-paced tactical shooters focusing on strategy and tactics, but now most shooters follow the same model of big set pieces, regenerating health, linear levels, and “cinematic experiences.” The realistic tactical shooters with in-depth planning have almost entirely disappeared in recent years.This game focuses on realistic weapons modeling, squad based play, in a close-quarters battle setting. To succeed in this game you need to take things slow, study your environment, and execute flawlessly. If you get shot, there are consequences. You won’t be hiding behind a wall waiting for your health to regenerate. If a team member goes down, you will have to assess the situation and reallocate team members if necessary to complete the mission. Don’t expect all of the tools and plans to be forced fed to you – it is up to the player to ensure their team is equipped and ready for the tasks at hand.  With features such as realistic bullet penetration, accuracy, and recoil, choosing the proper weapons, ammunition, armor, and gear for the mission is up to you, so choose carefully.Gameplay modes include single player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer. If you are a fan of old school shooters where thinking meant more than running and gunning or perks, or if you are just looking for something different in your shooter games experience, this is the game for you.Key Features:Fight Smart in Deadly, Close Quarters Combat – Players must think and move tactically, stay alert, watch, listen and choose wisely while setting up their squad for the perfect shot.    Tackle Engagements That Are Different Every Time – Nonlinear maps allow for multiple tactics and approaches to both attack and defense. Gamers must choose their gear to best execute strategy.Out Think The Enemy – Gamers need to work closely and communicate well with their team to not only attack the enemy but to coordinate to secure multiple objectives.",226631,Serellan LLC,505 Games,GenreAction*GenreSimulation*GenreStrategy,TagFPS*TagAction*TagTactical*TagSimulation*TagStrategy*TagMultiplayer*TagOnlineCo-Op*TagShooter*TagCo-op*TagFirst-Person*TagKickstarter*TagRealistic*TagWalkingSimulator*TagSingleplayer*TagHorror*TagAdventure*TagStealth*TagDifficult*TagFunny*TagIndie,4

237870,Planet Explorers,"In Planet Explorers, it is the year 2287, one of the first colony ships sent out by Earth arrives at the planet Maria, in the Epsilon Indi Star System. During its landing sequence, something appears in front of the massive ship that causes it to lose control and crash into the planet. Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats, but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer, gather, build, create, fight, and ultimately, build a new home.Game Modes Planet Explorers will feature single and multiplayer modes.  In single player there are 3 distinct selections  Story Mode – Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, colony building, farming, ranching, training, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 100 types of potential enemies. Even though we’ve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers, in reality, players can choose to not fight so much as to just plant a farm, make some food, keep the colonists alive, negotiate with the sentient aliens, and defend the perimeter from the local life forms. That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending. Story mode also features coop with other players. Adventure Mode – This mode is based on a procedural map generated from a seed. Currently, it comes in a 40X40 kilometer map. Players will be able to complete random missions, defeat bosses, and explore different landscapes in the mode and eventually be able to setup conditions that they want to play (such as tower defense or attack an alien camp). This mode will also feature survival gameplay. The randomization in this mode will eventually pull in player made objects and locations so that a world will always feature something new and unique. Build Mode – In this mode, there are no enemies and an infinite amount of building material. It also currently comes in a 40X40km map. Players will be able to build whatever they want in this mode, including everything in the Creations Editor. Think of this as the perfect testing ground to test everything you build. Or…it’s your place to build your garden without ever worrying about the pesky aliens. Multiplayer allows Local Area Network and player hosted servers. It features several modes but some are still on the drawing board or going through technical trials so the final result is still in flux. Players playing multiplayer should be able to bring at least one of their created objects into multiplayer games, be it a sword, gun, or vehicle.  Coop – Coop comes in many selections, such as adventure mode, tower defense mode, build mode, etc. This is pretty much an open world sandbox with a max of 32 players (this number still needs to be stress tested). Versus – This mode allows teams of up to 16 players to battle against 16 players from another team. We allow full terrain manipulation in this mode. Currently, it's a point based system where one team wins if they reach a certain point level based on kills, built objects, resources mined, etc. Game Features Current  20+ hours of storyline70+ types of enemies20+ unique mainline NPCsAble to digAble to buildAble to plant farmAble to build colonyAble to have followersCreation Editor to create vehicles, weapons, objects, vtols, and moreDay/night cycle with realistic moon cyclesWeather system15+ types of mineral types200+ unique itemsResource scannerRealtime AI pathfindingMultiplayer COOPMultiplayer VSRealtime water physics Planned  Finish up the single player storyline30+ more enemy typesMore mainline NPCsMultiple boss typesStory EditorHerdingAI bot followersIngame music playerHardcore survival modeNegotiation with aliensWar with aliensMissions to the moonsMore objects in Creation Editor (boats, mechs, armor, etc.) Maybe  Riding animalsNPC MarryingNPC ProcreationSeason system",245256,Pathea Games,Pathea Games,GenreAction*GenreAdventure*GenreIndie*GenreRPG*GenreSimulation*GenreEarlyAccess,TagEarlyAccess*TagSandbox*TagOpenWorld*TagAdventure*TagRPG*TagCrafting*TagExploration*TagMultiplayer*TagSurvival*TagBuilding*TagIndie*TagSci-fi*TagAction*TagCo-op*TagSimulation*TagVoxel*TagSingleplayer*TagThirdPerson*TagActionRPG*TagMassivelyMultiplayer,38

The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun France in 1916. The game offers  3 distinct game-modes; Frontlines, Attrition and Rifle Deathmatch. Also many historically accurate features are included such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium. The Frontlines game mode is unique in its tactical complexity. The realistic trenches are challenging to fight in and require tactical cunning to capture and defend. The Entente and Central Powers strive to gain control of frontline sectors. One battle you’re rushing the enemy trenches during an offensive battle in order to gain ground. In another battle you might be defending your recently conquered ground against an enemy counter-attack. Players can choose to be part of one of the many squad-types in the game, each of whom have their own distinct tactical role. By working together with your friends, you can earn experience that improves the power and versatility of your squad. As you gain more experience fighting and get promoted in rank, you also earn Career Points which you can use to unlock specializations, weapons and equipment. In the Attrition game mode, the Entente and the Central Powers are pitted against each other in a single battle. Each side has a number of tickets which represents the amount of manpower they have. When a player is killed and respawns, a ticket is deducted from the side who the player belonged to. When a side has no more tickets, players of that side cannot respawn. The Rifle Deathmatch is a free-for-all game mode, where all players are pitted against each other in a thrilling contest of skill using only bolt-action rifles. Verdun key features include: •Realistic World War 1 gameplay: Authentic weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience and artillery barrages•Tactical squad-based FPS:  Unique squad leveling system, distinct squad types and roles, voice chat•True trench warfare:   Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum-based attack and counter-attack gameplay•Authentic World War 1 setting:  Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields set on the Western Front•Challenging game modes:  Team-based Frontline, tactical Attrition and skill-based Rifle Deathmatch   The gameplay is as realistic and gritty as it gets. The authentic weapons need to be handled with skill, as they each feel differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim.  Also, the realistic bullet physics require you to lead your shots when firing on a moving target at long range. In the event of a gas attack, you need to put on your gas mask, which impairs your view and gives you a very claustrophobic experience. And if getting shot or gassed isn’t enough sudden artillery barrages, called in by NCO’s, can pin you down if caught in the open and obliterate your entire squad. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted!    Team play is what lies at the heart of Verdun. When you start a game, your first choice is to fight for either the Entente or the Central Powers. You and up to three other players, can form one of the different squad types available to that side.  Each squad has a specific tactic based on the historical units of that time. Depending on your squad’s type, players can choose a specific role within the squad, complete with historically accurate attire, weapons and special abilities. The more Co-op experience you and your squad mates earn together, the more powerful your squad will become and better abilities will  be unlocked. This progression is also shown visually as you and your squad get more advanced uniforms. You will also earn Career Points, which can be spent to unlock specializations, weapons and equipment.    The true WW1 battlefield experience has been captured in a real-time dynamic frontline, set in an historically accurate section of the Western Front. These frontline maps are comprised out of multiple sectors that can be captured by either side. Staying true to the typical attrition warfare of that time, both sides attack and counter-attack each other in turn, compelling you to defend each captured sector of trenches!    The development team has done extensive field research at Verdun and has been advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure Verdun is as historically accurate as it gets. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest details, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic World War 1 props and terrain layouts. Also, everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1; Gloomy clouded skies, an immersive interface combined with realistic sounds, accurate native voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the trenches, mud covered - trenches whilst peering over your rifle to spot the enemy.",398557,M2H,Blackmill Games,GenreAction*GenreIndie*GenreSimulation*GenreStrategy,TagWorldWarI*TagFPS*TagMultiplayer*TagHistorical*TagAction*TagWar*TagRealistic*TagShooter*TagFirst-Person*TagTactical*TagSimulation*TagStrategy*TagMilitary*TagIndie*TagTeam-Based*TagCo-op*TagAtmospheric*TagSingleplayer*TagAdventure*TagRPG,62
242920,Banished,"In this city-building strategy game, you control a group of exiled travelers who decide to restart their lives in a new land. They have only the clothes on their backs and a cart filled with supplies from their homeland.

The townspeople of Banished are your primary resource. They are born, grow older, work, have children of their own, and eventually die. Keeping them healthy, happy, and well-fed are essential to making your town grow. Building new homes is not enough—there must be enough people to move in and have families of their own.

Banished has no skill trees. Any structure can be built at any time, provided that your people have collected the resources to do so. There is no money. Instead, your hard-earned resources can be bartered away with the arrival of trade vessels. These merchants are the key to adding livestock and annual crops to the townspeople’s diet; however, their lengthy trade route comes with the risk of bringing illnesses from abroad.

There are twenty different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, and blacksmithing, to mining, teaching, and healing. No single strategy will succeed for every town. Some resources may be more scarce from one map to the next. The player can choose to replant forests, mine for iron, and quarry for rock, but all these choices require setting aside space into which you cannot expand.

The success or failure of a town depends on the appropriate management of risks and resources.",1483128,Shining Rock Software LLC,Shining Rock Software LLC,GenreIndie*GenreSimulation*GenreStrategy,TagCityBuilder*TagStrategy*TagSimulation*TagSurvival*TagIndie*TagSingleplayer*TagSandbox*TagMedieval*TagRelaxing*TagResourceManagement*TagDifficult*TagEconomy*TagOpenWorld*TagProceduralGeneration*TagHistorical*TagBuilding*TagManagement*TagAtmospheric*TagRTS*TagCasual,77

244850,Space Engineers,"Space Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration and survival in space and on planets. Players build space ships, space stations, planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military), pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes, there is no limit to what can be built, utilized and explored. Space Engineers features a realistic, volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled, disassembled, damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes. Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass, inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity. Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesn't use technologies that wouldn't be feasible in the near future. Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects, but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

247000,Talisman: Digital Edition,"Talisman Digital Edition - The Magical Quest Game for 1 to 6 players.  The officially licensed multiplayer version of the classic fantasy adventure board game, Talisman. In Talisman Digital Edition, there are 14 characters a player can control, from the heroic Warrior to the powerful Sorceress. In this perilous adventure, players battle it out to journey across a dangerous land and be the first to claim the Crown of Command, a magical artefact with the power to destroy all rivals and make the bearer the true ruler of the kingdom. On your travels, you will need strength, courage and some good dice rolls to survive the dangers you face and beat your opponents to the centre of the board.Features - Multiplayer modes for up to 6 players. Play against AI opponents. 14 characters to choose from.  17 powerful spells to cast. Many expansions available post-release.  Detailed, interactive tutorial. Based on the Revised 4th Edition by Fantasy Flight Games Frequently Asked Questions What is Talisman? Talisman is a board game in which you move around the board building up your character’s strength and magic power by battling monsters, finding treasures, completing quests and trying to be the first player to reach the centre space – the Crown of Command. How is Talisman: Digital Edition different to Talisman: Prologue? Talisman: Prologue is a single-player only game in which you tried to complete a series of challenges using the rules of Talisman. Talisman: Digital Edition is the full board game experience for up to 6 players, using the same rules as the board game. Can I play dirty? That’s at the very core of Talisman! Cast spells at other players to make them miss turns! Steal from them! Turn them into toads! Send powerful allies to do your fighting for you!  How replayable is the game? The emergent nature of the game means that every game will tell its own tale. The board starts with just the playing pieces and builds up to become a land filled with terrible danger and fabulous treasure! As you move around the board, you must make careful decisions about where to travel as each space can become more dangerous or more helpful as the game progresses. To help you get around, players can use things like teleporting, magic portals and fate, which allows you to re-roll your dice to get different results. How long is a game of Talisman? The physical board game can take 2-5 hours with 6 players, but our digital version cuts that down drastically, with an offline 6 player game typically taking no more than 1 hour. Offline and online games can be saved and resumed at any time so your adventures can take as long as you like! We’ve also added some features which decrease the length of games – House rules and Runestone cards. House rules change the basic rules slightly to speed-up the game and Runestone cards, exclusive to this digital edition, give characters extra abilities and allow them to become very powerful much quicker, making for shorter games. Is there a hotseat mode? Yes! Look your opponents in the eyes as you face them in deadly combat or sneak up from the shadows and steal their favourite items! All of the fun and social enjoyment of the physical game is captured in the digital version, but with no setup time! What’s included with the base game and are there expansions? For the initial purchase, everything that you get with the physical board game is included – all of the characters, spells and adventure cards, plus a few bonuses we've added. Expansions will be added and the first six, The Reaper, The Frostmarch, The Dungeon, The Highland, The Sacred Pool and The City are available to purchase now. These add lots more spells, events, monsters, characters and alternative endings! Extra characters are also available to purchase, including rare characters from Talisman’s history. Talisman © Games Workshop Limited 1983, 1985, 1994, 2007.

Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills? And if that weren’t enough, you’ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500 emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via “ClicknStart” and other big surprises! With hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone who’s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!   New Steam Features include key binding support for all foods and events, a new gameplay option called CookBets where you will receive randomized challenges each day, fifty new spam emails and options as well as improvements to UI across the board, and full Steam Achievements, Steam Cloud, Steam Leaderboards with special Steam Challenges and Trading Cards support. Includes the upgrade pack, ""Extra Crispy Edition,"" that brings ten new foods to the game including Lobster, Bananas Foster, Enchiladas, Sushi and more! Steam Controller, DualShock 4, Xbox 360, Wii U Pro Controller, DualShock 3 and Xbox One gamepad button mapping fully supported for compatible controllers.

In the end you must decide whether to Prey or Pray.Key Features EXPLORE The game's landscape is a beautifully conceived vision of a post apocalyptic Chicago, ravaged by disaster and time. Almost every low and high-rise building can be individually explored in a cityscape that stretches 150 blocks. Beyond the city lies the Wastelands, an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth.  SURVIVE, CRAFT, TRADE, LOOT AND SHOOT Start off, armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether, poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished, and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life.  Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time, build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death, and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation.  TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS  Find safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory, and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct, with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world. Your actions have real repercussions enforced organically through reputation and standing. PLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONS Players can complete an assortment of individual or group missions to earn money, experience and reputation. Perform vital supply runs between the markets, work with your tribe to take down the swarms of Nether lead by the vicious boss Reaper that sporadically surge to attack neighborhoods, or keep the creatures out of the Safezones by working in groups to repair the anti-nether devices when they fail. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION  Nether offers a wide variety of character customization and allows you to play as a male or female character. There is a huge selection of cosmetic items and player taunts to assert your individuality along with entire outfits to play roles like survivalist, soldier and biker - or even just play in your underwear. OTHER Host your own private servers and control your settings and player populationFirst-person perspective creates a true survival experienceMeld of PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) gameplayNew weapons and items become available as players explore the game worldUp to 64 players per game serverSingle purchase, downloadable client allows full game access without subscription",655275,Phosphor Games Studio,"Nether Productions, LLC",GenreAction*GenreIndie*GenreMassivelyMultiplayer*GenreRPG*GenreSimulation,TagSurvival*TagOpenWorld*TagAction*TagMultiplayer*TagPost-apocalyptic*TagMassivelyMultiplayer*TagHorror*TagFPS*TagZombies*TagPvP*TagRPG*TagFirst-Person*TagSurvivalHorror*TagIndie*TagSimulation*TagCo-op*TagWalkingSimulator*TagAdventure*TagCrafting*TagPvE,10

While this was presented as a chance to earn back their place in society by working hard for the common good, they understood that in fact they would be slave labour, sent to colonize an unexplored planet. All they knew about Auriga Prime was what the probes told them: it had water, temperate zones, plant life, and plenty of metals in the crust.  In fact, the planet Auriga once hosted a major settlement of the galaxy-travelling ancestors known as the Endless. In addition, the planet was still orbited by a functioning (and well cloaked) defensive system, which sprang eagerly to life upon the arrival of the Success. Within a few minutes, the ship was nothing but a few large chunks of metal falling toward the planet.  Every set of holding cells also functioned as an escape pod, so the ship let itself disintegrate and the surviving prisoners fell bruised but (temporarily) alive and (momentarily) safe to the planet below. Safe, that is, until they realized that they had crashed through some sort of facility of the Endless, down to a sub-basement so deep and ancient it might as well be called a dungeon… Gather A Team.

249380,Carmageddon: Reincarnation,"HEADS UP!! •	WARNING: this game contains humour, strong language and violence that some may find offensive. •	Check your PC specification against the required specifications before purchase.About the GameCarmageddon: Reincarnation is the driving sensation where pedestrians (and cows) equal points and your opponents are a bunch of crazies in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. It’s the antidote to racing games!!  In 1997, a videogame was released that caused establishment scandal and media hysteria around the world. Banned in some countries, censored in others, and even condemned by a Pope, overnight it became the poster child for everything that’s wrong in society… and therefore right in a videogame.    The game was CARMAGEDDON. For a generation of gamers coming to the end of a decade of 2D, wireframe, and corridor combat, it was an awesome introduction to the concept of the “real” 3D open world, do-whatever-the-feck-you-like, chuck-out-the-rulebook-and-just-BE-STUPID gameplay. And in doing so it also introduced the gaming world to the whole concept of realistic physics and real-time dynamic damage. What’s more, it was the FUNNIEST GAME EVER. So what have we done to update the game that was not only one of the most controversial titles of its day, but also the most innovative and technically advanced of its generation? Well controversy is pretty hard to whip up these days, but we are still proudly offering you the chance to turn PEDESTRIANS into POINTS (which continues to get certain sections of society hot under the collar) using your car or a whole host of hilarious ped pulping POWERUPS! And we continue to be boldly innovative and technically bloody clever – our CAR CRUSHING CODE continues to be the envy of anything else out there. Plus it’s all more HILARIOUS than ever! All this means that what you get is a Carmageddon fit for the 21st Century, tuned for today’s fun-seeking bloodthirsty adrenaline junkie game fans…   Play an adrenaline pumping bunch of game modes against the new improved AI opponents, or online against the rest of the Carmafan masses! Progress your Career through the Carma ranks or have a MultiPlayer romp in a Car Crusher, Fox 'n' Hounds (always been Stainless MP game session favourite!), Death Race or Checkpoint Stampede event, frenetic fun filled with Carmageddon’s trademark over-the-top violence, crazy PowerUps and non-stop laughs… And relive all the mangling mayhem with a fabulously updated Action Replay System, with multiple cameras and replay options – it’ll mean you never miss a pile-up again! Get those movies online and brag about your ped culling achievements. And there will be plenty of THOSE too – oh yes… Achievements, Challenges and Collectibles to hunt down, that’ll keep the whole family entertained for hour upon happy blood and oil splattered hour. The game features:Single Player Career modeFreeplay modeOnline & Offline Multiplayer modeCarMODgeddon mods mode  The Car Is The Star! Carmageddon: Reincarnation features a wide and varied range of cool, crazy, custom killing machines; each with its own highly distinctive “character”. Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand – wrecking opponents and killing peds! Carmageddon basically invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and the scenery, and so it’s obviously our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system. Crush, bend, twist, and completely mangle your opponents’ and your own car – smash parts off, or split it in two; the original game was all about wrecking motors and pummelling pedestrians, and we’ll be taking this to a whole new level! Of course Power, Armour, and Offensive upgrades make a return, along with new customising options, allowing you to personalise the killing capabilities of your preferred rides.  A host of old favourites make a comeback, along with some all-new faces. Only ever seen before as low resolution mugshots, now you get to see them from head to toe (well, head to knees in the case of Screwie) in full HD 3D glory – usually as they smash through their windscreen and hurtle past (or INTO) yours!  The new environments are amalgamations of the best bits from the numerous chunks of landscape that we all loved to tear around in Carmageddon. “Bleak City”, “Dusty Trails”, “MagNuChem” and ""Snowy"" levels all return in updated forms, with their memorable landmark features such as the Loop ’de’ Loop, acid pits and Football Stadium. Everything is reassuringly surreal; hell, we’ve even managed to incorporate a giant food mixer into a level! The topography and detail in the locations is updated and enhanced, with even more fun stuff to smash into, smash up, snap off, and send careening into the poor pedestrian population. “Nice Shot Sir!” And talking of pedestrians…  Once again, the game features a varied mix of adult pedestrians of all ages, shapes, persuasions and species (Carmageddon is an equal opportunities Ped Slaughterfest). Classic pedestrians are back, such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick, with their famous cry “I was in the war!”, plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks, fat bastards, and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces – including the Stainless dev team and some guest appearances by the generous Kickstarter Backers who pledged their way into a VIP role in the game!  PowerUps are back (well, they couldn’t not appear in a game bearing the name Carmageddon, could they!) and this time they’re even funnier, surrealier, hurtier, and messier than ever! Lots of the classic PUps (as we call them) return in super-enhanced form, such as Repulsificators, Kangaroos & Solid Granites. Then we have all new PUps like ""Pelvic Thrust"" and a variety under the heading “Tossers”! Combine PUps to create hilarious combo results like “Groovin’ Helium Filled Peds”, or “Peds without legs at the Temporary Rapture""!  Leaderboards. Challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard using skill or brute force!Achievements. A suitably warped array of mad Feats and Exploits will garner you the rewards that every gamer dreams of.Challenges: Do the most stupid things, collect meaningless trinkets and waste hours of your life in the pursuit of ultimately pointless goals!Smelly Bushes: We’ve hidden a variety of these specially fragrant Easter Eggs throughout the game to keep you busy and entertained!CarMODgeddon: The whole game is MODdable for your MODding pleasure!

The Plan was developed as a side project by Krillbite Studio, who's currently finishing their main project Among the Sleep.""Hey, You Should Play This"" - Patrick Klepek, Giantbomb""Some may argue that The Plan isn't really a game and it definitely occupies the same terrain as Journey, Passage, and Dear Esther, but it's shorter than Journey, prettier than Passage, and less overwrought than Dear Esther, making it well worth taking a punt on for the low price of free."" - Jeffrey Matulef, Eurogamer""It’s that space in the mechanics for thought and interpretation that I appreciate most here. The Plan won’t break your brain, but it’s a nicely contemplative journey."" - Nathan Grayson, RockPaperShotgun""In order, here are the emotions I experienced during the three minutes it took me to play The Plan, the new free morsel from the Norweigan indie developer Krillbite: confusion, frustration, boredom, fear, amusement, delight, joy, enchantment, and regret. One of the things independent games ask us to do is accept that a three-minute game can be as valid as a thirty-hour one. Games like these make it hard to disagree."" - Joseph Bernstein, Buzzfeed""Krillbite Studio, the developers behind Among The Sleep, have gone on and released a most polished, visually stunning and freeware new game"" - Konstantinos Dimopoulos, Indiegames.com""Krillbite's The Plan is a short, sharp experimental deliberation on the meaning of life."" - Andy Chalk, The Escapist",518385,Krillbite Studio,Krillbite Studio,GenreCasual*GenreFreetoPlay*GenreIndie,TagFreetoPlay*TagIndie*TagAtmospheric*TagShort*TagCasual*TagSimulation*TagSingleplayer*TagExploration*TagGreatSoundtrack*TagMusic*TagAdventure*TagExperimental*TagFlight*TagRelaxing*Tag2D*TagHorror*TagFunny*TagWalkingSimulator*TagPlatformer*TagAction,80

In coming updates these features will be expanded upon with even more depth and a wider variety of choices to survive the increasing dangers of the world. Play alone or with friends, run your own server or join others. 7 Days to Die development was launched following a successful Kickstarter campaign in August 2013, demonstrating the initial prototype. Joining us in early access now will help support the cause and ensure continued expansion of the development team, their efforts and the planning and addition of even more features and depth eagerly awaited by fans.  Many of our fans have commented in these early stages that they feel we are building the survival\zombie game they have always wanted.

Hammer away just like real building and use Land Claim blocks to protect your fort in PvP.Structural Integrity - Buildings and terrain formations which are too unstable can fall apart if proper supports are not built. Some building materials are stronger than others and pieces which break off and fall can be dangerous or deadly if they fall on you or enemies.Item Crafting & Degradation - With a continually growing list of over 250 recipes, gather resources such as plant fibers, wood and metal to create weapons and tools such as hand made crossbows, knives and hammers. As your tools wear out over time, use your crafting skills to repair them.Quality Ranged Gear - Guns, weapons, tools, armor and clothing have quality ranges which govern attributes to provide hundreds of thousands of item permutations. Level up and craft better quality items to survive.Plants and Animals - Locate seeds to plant and grow vegetables, and head out into the wilderness to hunt animals once the cabinets in abandoned buildings are already plundered.Stealth System - Sneak past zombies who can see, hear and smell you and smelly items in your inventory and throw rocks to distract them.Buff/Debuff System  – Enjoy or deal with a multitude of buffs or debuffs like a caffeine buzz or a broken leg in our rapidly growing Buff/Debuff System with over a dozen boosts or ailments.Cooperative Mode - Tired of zombie apocalypses that are more about fighting humans than zombies? Team up with your friends to work with other survivors rather than against them, using group efforts to build settlements and safety. Character Customization - Full Character creation system with face/body morphing, custom skin, eye, hair color, facial hair and a multitude of visible clothing and armor.Drivable Vehicles - A  badass vehicle system with a Mini Bike that has parts quality, storage and locking.

264200,One Finger Death Punch,"Experience cinematic kung-fu battles in the fastest, most intense brawler the indie world has ever seen! With the unique 1:1 response system of One Finger Death Punch, players will feel the immediate feedback of every bone-crunching hit. Pay tribute to the masters using five classic kung-fu styles mixed with additional weapons. Combine face-to-face combat with throwing weapons to recreate complex fight choreographies or just send bad guys flying through glass windows. Explore a world map with over 250 stages, 13 modes, and 3 difficulty levels. Unlock 21 different skills that can be combined in thousands of ways to assist you in your journey. Put your kung-fu to the ultimate test in the survival mode. One Finger Death Punch is a game you can “feel”. The direct connection between your mouse and your character on the screen will be a new experience for many players. When you string together a long, complex string of kills, it feels like something “you” did rather than something the game let you do. When you play it you feel like you’re actually playing a Xiao Xiao stick animation video. We took inspiration from every kung-fu film we’ve seen. Every bit of effort was poured into delivering an easy to play game that was as addictive to play as Tetris. Every Press Matters! DO NOT BUTTON MASH!  One of the biggest challenges we had while making the game is stopping the player from button mashing. When our friends play tested our game they’d instinctively button mash, they couldn’t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game’s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies. If you punch even once when there’s no enemy in front of you, you’re going to miss. If you miss, chances are you’re going to get hit. It’s a simple system but it’s ruthless to button mashers. We spent much time setting up visual and audio queues as well as many warnings trying to steer players away from their natural button mashing tendencies.",482827,Silver Dollar Games,Silver Dollar Games,GenreAction*GenreCasual*GenreIndie,TagAction*TagFast-Paced*TagIndie*TagBeat'emup*TagFighting*TagSingleplayer*TagCasual*Tag2D*TagMartialArts*TagDifficult*TagArcade*TagGreatSoundtrack*TagRhythm*TagMouseonly*TagGore*TagBlood*TagAnime*TagFunny,99

Choose from three distinct types of breed, depending on your personal taste in look and style of play, may it be Nightbreed, Halfbreed or Daybreed. There are just too many unique aspects that differentiate the breeds to list here, but keep in mind that the sight range of Night- and Daybreed varies with the day cycles and that some items can be limited to a specific breed.Customization, Armory and ArtifactsDeadbreed® features a player centric customization feature, meaning the player has greater influence over his Hero’s look and capabilities. The items you equip not only shape the way the hero looks while playing, they dictate the way he/she moves and attacks to. Equipping a sword and a shield will make your hero a melee fighter with the sword’s range, while re-equipping the same hero as an archer changes your range and attack to bow and arrow. This opens up totally new ways to explore custom items builds best suited for that particular hero’s abilities, opponents and game scenarios. In addition to the possibility to adapt and remodel your favorite hero’s equipment choosing from a vast base armory, Deadbreed® features Artifacts. Artifacts are built during games like “normal” items, however they are unique meaning there can only be one in play at any given time during a game, adding an additional layer of strategy and tactical planning to hero item builds. In addition to this, Artifacts level up with games, unlocking relic slots that open up further customization opportunities for you to tune specific items for your favorite heroes. For fans of RPGs, the concept of “socketing” items should feel very familiar and for MOBA fans, you could really simplify this by saying we have moved the “runes” stats modifications associated with the player to individual items instead, and added unique effects on top to make these items really stand out in gameplay.The SentinelsThe Sentinels are ancient guardians of the Deadbreed® bloodlines – arbitrators of the infernal battlegrounds where dead breed strive to break their undead bonds and lay to final rest. These immortal deities have been charged solely with construction of and ruling over the battlegrounds of death and decay as a punishment for their doings in the real world, but behind the façades, they vie for power while swaying the dead breeds to their philosophy – an eternal conflict among themselves for the right to lead an uprise from this hell and reclaim their rightful place in the cosmos. As you progress in the game, you’ll uncover the cabal of the Sentinels and learn more about their individual weaknesses and strengths and how they fit your heroes and play style. You prove your Zeal for a Sentinel by choosing it as your Guardian in a match. Then the outcome of that game will modify your Standing with that particular Sentinel, affecting its strengths, abilities and enhancements in coming games making it a more formidable last boss for the enemy team to conquer in order to win (and the other way around). As your Zeal increases, you’ll open up further paths of the cabal and gain access to older and more powerful Sentinels to devote to. Will you stay loyal to a specific breed lineage or even a single Sentinel? There are strategic decisions to be made and rewards to be claimed on a daily basis as your loyalty to the Sentinels are put to the test.Maps, Dungeons and PvE Features  The Early Access kicks off with The Graveyard. At its core, the Graveyard is a 3vs3 two-lane map with a Citadel at each end protected by monoliths. The overall goal of the map is to break the crux on the gates to gain access to the Citadel and defeat the enemy team’s Sentinel. The Graveyard also features a Troll Cave where you can summon a Troll to fight for your side, two smaller dungeons on each team’ s side of the map and an entrance to a larger Dungeon placed dead center of the map. The concept of Dungeons is familiar to all hack’n slash fans – and our game has plenty of monsters and loot, however the big difference being that our Dungeons are much, much smaller in size and offer no way out than the way you went in, leaving you vulnerable to the enemy team. So, dungeons are our “mini-adventure” version of other MOBA’s monster nests.Ranked ModeRanked mode allows you to test your skills against opponents of comparable skill and earn special ranks to reflect your skill. Winning and losing matches can gain or lose rank, and special rewards, like custom Insignia, gravestones etc. Each player's rank is reflected in their Gravestone and plaque. There are currently 5 divisions ranging from Bronze up to Diamond, with each division split in 5 series.",377978,Deadbreed AB,Deadbreed AB,GenreAction*GenreAdventure*GenreFreetoPlay*GenreIndie*GenreRPG*GenreStrategy*GenreEarlyAccess,TagEarlyAccess*TagMOBA*TagFreetoPlay*TagRPG*TagStrategy*TagIndie*TagAction*TagAdventure*TagMultiplayer*TagCo-op*TagDark*TagDarkFantasy*TagHorror,22

282010,Carmageddon Max Pack,"HEADS UP! This game contains humour, strong language and violence that some may find offensive.THE COMIC!! Check out the official Carmageddon comic series! Click on the image!About the Game Carmageddon is the original freeform driving sensation, where pedestrians (and cows!) equal points, and your opponents are a bunch of crazies in a twisted mix of automotive killing machines. The game features anarchic drive-wherever-you-like gameplay and over-the-top surreal comedy violence. It’s the racing game where racing is for wimps. Now the same Mac & PC classic that was BANNED AROUND THE WORLD is back! Carmageddon features real-world environments that have been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level is sprinkled generously with power-ups that have a vast variety of mad effects, adding a whole extra level of craziness to the proceedings. In every event you have the option to “play it your way”… Waste all your opponents, kill every pedestrian, or (perish the thought) complete all the laps. Oh and watch out – the cops in their super-tough armoured patrol vehicles are lurking, and if they catch you being bad they’ll be down on you like several tons of cold pork.   ""Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! Members of the public, you have ONE minute to reach minimum safe distance!""  Crazy range of vehicles and drivers, each with their own personality and driving style.The game that pioneered true 3D physics, The game that pioneered dynamic vehicle damageThe game that pioneered splattering grannies. And cows.In fact, splatter a wide range of seriously scared pedestrians. 28 dangerously deranged Opponents11 wildly exhilarating EnvironmentsCareer Mode featuring 36 satisfyingly violent LevelsRace and Wreck opponents to unlock 30 playable cars!Over 40 fun-packed Power Ups and “Power Downs”.Great open world track design allowing complete freedom to explore.Hidden bonus areas to find.  Ludicrously satisfying, arcade-style gameplay.   The aim is for the player to work their way up the ranking system, from 99th place to first. The player vehicle is pitted against a number of computer controlled competitors, in locations such as cities, mines and desert towns. Levels can be beaten in one of three ways:  Completing all the laps of the race course, as one would a normal racing game.""Wasting"" (wrecking) all the opponents vehicles.Killing all the pedestrians in the area. Each level has a time limit, but more time may be gained by passing through checkpoints, collecting powerups, damaging/destroying the competitors' cars, and by running over pedestrians (with bonuses awarded for style).These actions also reward the player with Credits, which can be used to make instant repairs or recover the car (after falling down a chasm, for example). They can also be used to upgrade Armour, Power and Offense stats in the Parts Shop between races. This is also the time to switch which car to drive if others have been obtained.As well as opponents partaking in the 'race', some levels also contain a number of heavily armored Cop Cars, which will activate their sirens and hound the player when provoked. They can be attacked and destroyed, but do not count as opponents. A single ""Super Squad Car"" exists in one level, and it can be claimed if destroyed.An Action Replay with multiple camera viewpoints is available at any point during a race.  Carmageddon won the “Game of the Year” trophy in the 1997 PC Zone Reader awards.  Carmageddon 1 & 2 were “Driving Game of the Year” 1997/1998. SELECTED REVIEWS OF THE ORIGINAL GAMEOriginally released for the PC in 1997, Carmageddon was an instant hit and the titles went on to sell over 2 million copies worldwide. Here’s what a sample of the gaming press thought at the time: “Carmageddon is visceral, violent, vehicular fun...” - GameSpot 8.8 out of 10 “Carmageddon, to get straight to the point, is one of the best computer games I've ever played… Carmageddon is God!” - Duncan McDonald 95% Classic Award PC Zone Magazine “Carmageddon is one of those games that only come along once in a blue moon. An essential purchase.” - Escape Magazine 6 out of 6 “The gameplay is spot on and anyone with a dark enough sense of humour should give it a go.” - Computer Gaming World 4 out of 5 “So next time you gun down coppers on GTA VI, just remember, Carmageddon’s controversy was there first, and you have a lot to thank it for.” - RetroGarden    Carmageddon is the first of a series of graphically violent driving-oriented video games. It was conceived and developed by Stainless Games, published by SCi and released June 30, 1997 on PC & Mac.It was, and remains, a poster child for video game controversy. The controversy surrounded the game's central premise; that of earning reward for running down innocent pedestrians.The game was notable for its realistic and ground-breaking physics, and for its in-game action replay features. It was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox 3D driving game, and may have influenced other later games including the Driver and Grand Theft Auto series. ABOUT STAINLESS GAMESStainless was founded in 1994 by Patrick Buckland, a veteran of the games industry going back to the Jurassic period of 1982, and Neil Barnden, who used to have hair like a mammoth. A team of 8 worked on the original Carmageddon at Stainless, and 5 are still with the company today, although a couple of them are now kept manacled in a small padded room in the cellar. Stainless Games now employs around one hundred mad, dedicated people of assorted gender, height and width.

User Score “Carma II does for Carmageddon what Doom did for Wolfenstein 3D: takes the concept and fine-tunes it, producing a game that is a ghoulish dream come true for fans of the original... and a kick in the cock for the critics.” -PC Zone 9.5   Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now is the second of a series of graphically violent driving-oriented video games.

282070,This War of Mine,"In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.This War of Mine: Inspired by real-life eventsControl your survivors and manage your shelterCraft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you surviveMake decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experienceRandomized world and characters every time you start a new gameCharcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme Previews:IGN This War of Mine might be the war game we need.Gamespot I was intrigued by This War of Mine's attempts to portray the consequences of war in a way that games have largely ignored in the past. The fact that the psychological and emotional challenges of living under such horrifying conditions are something you have to consider as you struggle gives me added hope that it might treat its hefty and important subject matter with the gravity and complexity that it deserves.Game Informer 11bit is blazing a new thematic trail amidst the currently popular survival genre, and so far the studio seems to have something special on its hand.",1000952,11 bit studios,11 bit studios,GenreAdventure*GenreIndie*GenreSimulation,TagSurvival*TagWar*TagAtmospheric*TagSimulation*TagSingleplayer*TagStrategy*TagIndie*TagCrafting*TagChoicesMatter*TagAdventure*TagStealth*Tag2D*TagPost-apocalyptic*TagSideScroller*TagDifficult*TagPoint&Click*TagOpenWorld*Tag2.5D*TagPlatformer*TagRogue-like,93
284160,BeamNG.drive,"BeamNG.drive is a realistic, immersive driving game offering near-limitless possibilities. Our soft-body physics engine simulates every component of a vehicle in real time, resulting in realistic, dynamic behavior.                                        The driving feel is authentic and visceral, and crashes are realistic and violent; yet the physics are accessible enough to drive with a keyboard or gamepad while still being authentic with a full racing wheel with uncompromising realism. Environments and vehicles in BeamNG.drive are hand-crafted with passionate attention to detail. With years of meticulous design, research, and experience, we authentically recreate the feeling and excitement of real world driving. We are a small team from around the world with no obligations to publishers or outside interests. Our users and modding community are our first priority. Help us make BeamNG.drive the ultimate driving experience and discover what an open and uncompromising soft-body vehicle simulator can be.Why is BeamNG.drive the game for you? As an open world vehicle simulator, BeamNG.drive will cover a large array of vehicular disciplines - everything from a delivery mission in a box truck to a high speed rally race or a destruction derby. The vehicle customization and detail will allow you to make your car or truck all your own - fix it up, upgrade it, or strip away body panels to reduce weight. There are a lot of different types of gameplay we want to implement beyond just racing and crashing, such as police chases, stunt challenges, and other specialized minigames. Eventually we would like to have some kind of single player open world career mode, with persistent vehicle ownership and procedurally generated used vehicles to buy and events to run them in. In some ways, BeamNG.drive is about doing anything you want with a car or truck - the stuff other games don't let you do. You can go off-roading in a family sedan or hurl a delivery truck around a racing circuit, all with beautiful soft-body simulation physics. You can mod those same vehicles to be racing beasts, derby monsters, or off-road behemoths - or just thrash them stock. At the end of the day, BeamNG.drive gives you the gameplay you want, and doesn't force you to do anything that you don't think is fun or interesting.The future of the game and our physics engine As we optimize our game and computer technology improves, the amount of vehicles which can be simultaneously simulated at a smooth framerate will increase. Right now you can run 4 to 6 cars at one time on a high end quad-core processor. Each vehicle has around 400 nodes and 4000 beams, all being simulated 2000 times per second. We hope to expand the number of simultaneous vehicles possible to at least 8 with a mid-range processor. We will also look towards having multiplayer in the future, but it may be some time before we can create the multiplayer experience everyone is expecting. We are well aware of the demand for multiplayer and we want it just as much as you, but for the short term we are focusing on the single player career mode, various driving events, fixing bugs, and creating more content. It is feasible that we could implement local and/or same PC multiplayer in the interim. Also, the possibilities extend beyond land vehicles. Users in our community have already made planes and helicopters that fly purely with the existing vehicle aerodynamic physics, with no cheating whatsoever. BeamNG can simulate aircraft in a very authentic way due to its soft-body physics. All the flex that happens to a real plane's airframe arises naturally in BeamNG, and the consequences of excessive stress are also modeled. Fly too fast and your wings will start to bend and rip off. The potential for the BeamNG physics engine is huge.Alpha Access Features  All future updates to BeamNG.drive included for free (alpha, beta), also including the final game Soft-body physics sandbox 7 detailed, customizable, destructible vehicles, with more to come 7 terrains to explore and drive across, with more to come Frequent updates adding terrains, vehicles, features, gameplay, and bug fixes Full modding and content creation capabilities - make maps and vehicles, and script gameplay Use the built-in terrain editor and any 3D modeling, image editing, and text editing software Online authentication is only necessary to update; the game itself does not need an internet connection to run. Exclusive access to a section of our forum where you can talk directly to the devs and report bugs, suggest features, etc. The exclusive forum section also contains 3rd-party content, including vehicles and terrains. In addition, you get a little BeamNG.drive logo under your avatar on the BeamNG forumsAlpha TestersUsers that already entered the alpha testing via our website can get a free Steam key.Our goalsOur main focus is on how things move rather than how things look on the screen. We aim to bring our expertise in real time soft-body physics and soft-body physics model design to the forefront of game physics simulation, making available the technology and know-how to as a wide an audience as possible. To achieve this, we are designing the engine and corresponding assets, so as to be independent of the underlying game engine and operating system. Right now the physics engine is running on a multicore CPU configuration, but we are also in the process of supporting GPUs via OpenCL.Our missionTo have realistic, accurate, destructible, and malleable physics everywhere.

New updates regularly!      Arena: Cyber Evolution is free to play and we want it to stay this way forever. We believe that it should be at the core of any sport to be accessible for everyone to play and practice no matter what.As an independent game studio, we however need some money to keep developing the game and improving it.   This is why we integrated monetization features in the game with the possibility to buy skins, hats and other customizations with real money (but never pay to win mechanics!).

290080,Life is Feudal: Your Own,"“Life is Feudal: Your Own” (LiF:YO) is a medieval life simulator for 64 players on a 3km x 3km gameworld. It places you in a realistic medieval setting with the ability to host your own private world and set your own rules. This world has free terraforming and building features. You can build your own house anywhere in the world! Team up with your friends and build a village or city and repel attacks by other players who want to steal your lands and slaughter your cattle! A good castle with tall city walls might help you protect yourselves and your precious valuables   Included in your purchase, all Life is Feudal:YO owners will receive one character to gain full access to early mmo testing in Q2 2016, and the full massively multiplayer game - Life is Feudal:MMO once released. The combat system in our game is quite unique; it is a non-target and physics-based combat system. The direction of your attack depends on mouse movement. Basic movements combined with directional attacks can be mixed together to create deadly combos with special harmful effects. Battle formations are a new way to collaborate and control the situation on the battlefield with your fighting team. Depending on the battle situation, a group leader must issue the right commands to manage formations during a battle. The more group members that make up a given formation, the bigger the advantages they enjoy. A well organized group will always prevail over a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. True use of sandbox mechanics and not just the ""sandbox"" label being applied to the game. A great example is that player skill progression is not limited by artificial classes or roles. The Skill cap and Stat cap systems allow you to design a character, which fits your style of play perfectly. The crafting system contains a lot of sand and boxes too. :) An excellent example is how alchemy works almost the same way as it did in TES:Oblivion ©. The wikipedia and your friends won’t be able to help you because all the recipes are randomized for each character and the only way to learn them all is by experimentation. Farming will demand a sound understanding of different crops, soil fertilization and knowledge regarding when to plant or harvest your crops according to the current weather. An example of farming knowledge is knowing your crop fertilizer comes from your stables and barns, which you need to manage and clean in order to breed the best war horses on the continent! You will also need to feed and tend your other livestock as well.  Food is very important for character development and skill progression. The higher the quality and complexity of your meal, the faster you will progress through your skills. This places a cook on the same level of importance as other craftspeople such as blacksmiths, carpenters or alchemists.Features Unique Features:  Free Terraforming & Tunnel Building. 100% free terraforming and tunnel building! Dig tunnels, mines and moats and expand them in all dimensions almost without limit! You can raise and lower ground levels with a landfall effect. Substances include soil, rock, granite, ore veins, clay, sand, and much more!Battle Formation System. In massive battles you can react accordingly to the combat situation and provide your unit with certain bonuses, but to receive these bonuses, unit members must be well organized and always stay inside the formation shape.Unlimited Number of Unique Alchemy Combinations. There are over 40,000,000 alchemy combinations unique to each player! Unlike other online games, you need to learn, experiment and create your very own unique combinations. Alchemy is not simply a matter of character skill as it strongly emphasises spending time and resources on creating good recipes and combinations.Complex Food & Cooking System. Cooking is no longer a secondary or non-existent skill. Being a good cook that knows many complex and tasty recipes means that you and your friends will be better fed and will receive skill bonuses!Realistic Player Damage System. Based on human anatomy with fractures and bleeding wounds you can create unique and deadly combat tactics.Double Health & Stamina Bars. Double health and stamina bars represent better information about the status of your body. Players can be knocked unconscious or killed. They can also be temporarily out of breath or totally exhausted.These are only a few features that are listed. Craft and construct hundreds of items and build unique structures to create the world around you.

Coming Summer 2015 - Pre-Order Now!Dragonfall Steam Workshop  With the Shadowrun Editor, everyone is empowered to create and share their own stories and campaigns with the Steam Workshop community. This version of the Shadowrun Editor puts all assets from Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut as well as from Shadowrun Returns at creator’s fingertips. No advanced coding or art skills are required to create content using the Shadowrun Editor. Please note that Dragonfall Steam Workshop content is not compatible with our previous title, Shadowrun Returns.About the GameShadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed Dragonfall campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for Shadowrun Returns. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game: 5 all-new missions, alternate endings, new music, a redesigned interface, team customization options, a revamped combat system, and more - making it the definitive version of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience.  NOTE: The Director’s Cut is free to existing owners of the Dragonfall expansion for Shadowrun Returns. It will be automatically added to your Steam Library when the game is released.Man Meets Magic & MachineIn 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.   It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday.  Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: See why PC Gamer hailed Dragonfall as “one of the most memorable and complex RPG stories of the decade.” Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters. A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting: Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating it’s 25th anniversary. Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.New in the Director’s Cut Standalone: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title! Five All-New Missions: The Director’s Cut features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail. Revamped Combat System: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions. Redesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter. Customize Your Team: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission. Ten New Pieces of Original Music: Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the Dragonfall experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team. The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack: As a free bonus, the Director’s Cut includes the entire soundtracks from both Dragonfall AND our previous title, Shadowrun Returns. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the Director’s Cut.

a business man, an old man and a child.

They find themselves on a road which is apparently the same, but changes upon their perception of reality. The core of the gameplay is to explore in order to see how different is each point of view. The player will switch from one character to another trying to correctly and fully interact with all the environment. Missing an interaction or trying to interact with the wrong elements will determine ""loss"" in the game, causing the game to restart from the beginning.",688879,Fabio Ferrara,CyberCoconut,GenreFreetoPlay*GenreIndie*GenreEarlyAccess,TagEarlyAccess*TagFreetoPlay*TagIndie*TagWalkingSimulator*TagSingleplayer*TagFirst-Person*TagShort*TagAdventure*TagSimulation*TagAtmospheric*TagMultiplayer*TagHorror*TagOpenWorld*TagSurvival*TagGreatSoundtrack*TagStoryRich*TagAction*TagDifficult*TagCo-op*TagPixelGraphics,48

A game with considerable depth of strategy you must first know your own capabilities and that of your fleet before taking the fight to the enemy. Experience will expand your ability to choose which small victories to chase and how to then leverage them. Mastery of a single ship is your first step, dominance in the war for space coming as your knowledge increases.   The composition of your fleet is vital to your success.

Tests of high-energy heavy particles accelerators will result in billions of microscopic black hole rupturing the structure of time and space. This will become the point of no return. The Earth as we know it will cease to exist. This is a story of human strength. Three generations after the apocalypse, not only did humankind survive in the man-made hell – it continued to develop. Gradually, the infrastructure restored, wars stopped, people were returning to normal life. However, the crippled nature was barely starting to fight back... So-called anomalous activity zones started appearing all over the planet, like terrifying scars left by the man-made catastrophes. The vast territories live their own life, which looks like nothing you have seen before. Bloodthirsty mutated monsters, inexplicable phenomena, mysterious anomalies are but the tip of the iceberg. One of the Zones was formed in the vicinity of Ukraine, in an area combining the unmistakable atmosphere of Soviet times and the fast pace of modern life. In order to contain the dangers of the Zone, the government decided to fence the perimeter, and introduce quarantine in the area. Local residents found themselves trapped and left to their own devices. However, forbidden fruit is always the most enticing. And this was when the ""stalkers"" came in. Mystical artifact hunters, former military men, explorers, adventurers, armed gangsters and just those who love getting away with shooting live targets – they swarmed in like locusts in Egypt. This is a story about YOU.  Who will you become? Over 40 square kilometers of lands to explore, from closed science villages and abandoned military facilities, to the forests of Tunguska and snowy deserts of Terra Nova. Deadly mutants, anomalies and hundreds of main story quests. Huge choice of artifacts, gear and weapons. Repair broken things or assemble new gear from scratch. Improve dozens of skills and abilities. Be a doctor, a scientist, a hunter, a soldier or an engineer.

You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights!

333950,Medieval Engineers,"Digital Deluxe EditionSupport the developers by getting bonus digital content. The Deluxe edition includes the standard Medieval Engineers Early Access game plus the game’s Digital Soundtrack.Steam WorkshopShare your creations with the Community (upload and download worlds)About the GameMedieval Engineers is a sandbox game about engineering, construction and the maintenance of architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Players build cities, castles and fortifications; construct mechanical devices and engines; perform landscaping and underground mining. The game is inspired by real medieval technology and the way people built architectural works and mechanical equipment using medieval technology. Medieval Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and history and doesn't use any technologies that were not available in the 5th to 15th centuries. Medieval Engineers concentrates on construction aspects, but can be played as an action game too. We expect players to avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications. Medieval Engineers shouldn’t be about troops; it should be about the machinery you build. Medieval Engineers is the second “engineering” game developed by Keen Software House. The first one is Space Engineers, which sold over 1 million copies in its first year and is still a bestseller.Early Access Game modes  - Creative - unlimited resources, instant building, invulnerability, levitation - Survival - this mode is work-in-progress. Currently available: death/respawn, survival building, resource management, inventory, character stats (health, stamina, food)Single-player Multiplayer - alpha version (not final) - Creative and survival mode with your friends - Cooperative: build together with your friends, protect your castles/cities from barbarian raids - Competitive: battle against other players - Privacy customization: offline, private, friends only, public - Max 16 players (this may increase in the future)Castle siege mode - play as an attacker or defender and either defend your castle from opponents’ raid or lead the attack to take charge and capture the castleCharacter crafting - craft your tools using the basic resources such as scrap wood or small stonesDedicated servers - players can connect to a third party host, rather than using a player-host, in a peer-to-peer set-up. The result is a faster connection and a more fluid multiplayer performance with less lagBarbarians - first prototype of enemy AIBarbarian waves (survival mode) - barbarians will attack players in waves during the nightPeasants - first prototype of friendly AI. Able to pick up stones and move them to his spawn position.Weapons - Crossbow, swordFirst-person & Third-person Voxel hand – shape the terrain and its material (right now only creative mode voxel hand is implemented)Block types:  - Small: 0.25 meter (25 centimeters) - Large: 2.5 meters - Dynamic: can be used to construct carriages and machinery that is supposed to be moved around - Static: immovable and connected to earth; if a heavy load breaks its structural integrity it cracks and unsupported parts become dynamicBuilding blocks: stone walls (various shapes - from blocky to rounded), wooden walls and flooring, roofs (ceramic, thatched, hay), power source blocks (manual human labor), stored energy blocks (torsion spring), leverages, weights, swings, ropes, wooden beams of various length and shape… More will be added in future!Realistic physics – structural integrity, destructible objects (everything: from blocks to terrain), real proportions, volume, mass, storage capacity, integritySteam Workshop – share your creations with the CommunityModding - world files, 3D models, textures, shaders, API (scripting in-game objects in C#)32-bit & 64-bit – 64-bit version expands the amount of objects and blocks (almost unlimited) and terrain World management – generate new worlds, “save as” to multiple copies, auto-save every 5 minutes (can be turned on/off), edit world settings NOT IMPLEMENTED YET  Mechanical blocks: rotors, transmissions, transitionsWind power source blockBuilding blocks: torches and other sources of artificial light, flags... More will be added in the future! More to be added later  Please be sure to read the list of current features before you buy the game. It will give you an insight on what is or isn't actually working: http://www.medievalengineers.com/features.htmlPerformance NotesMedieval Engineers is in development and undergoing frequent optimizations. The performance will get better.  The performance depends on the complexity of your world and the configuration of your computer. Simple worlds run smoothly even on low-end computers, but a more complex world with rich object interactions could overload even high-end computers. Minimum requirements represent the bare minimum to run simple scenes and don’t guarantee a perfect experience.",239525,Keen Software House,Keen Software House,GenreAction*GenreIndie*GenreSimulation*GenreStrategy*GenreEarlyAccess,TagEarlyAccess*TagBuilding*TagMedieval*TagSandbox*TagPhysics*TagDestruction*TagOpenWorld*TagMultiplayer*TagSimulation*TagCrafting*TagSurvival*TagStrategy*TagSingleplayer*TagIndie*TagAction*TagRealistic*TagCo-op*TagVoxel*TagAdventure*TagAtmospheric,46

Unlike Faction Play, Quick Play matches do not influence the layout of Inner Sphere territories; these battles are fought purely for rewards and glory. In Faction Play you will field 4 ‘Mechs per match, lending your skills and allegiance to the Faction of your choosing in prolonged team-based engagements, conquering and defending planets in their name to earn rewards and expand your Faction's territory across the Inner Sphere. Gameplay Piloting a 'Mech to victory requires a mastery of tactical positioning, teamwork, and firing discipline. Strike out as a Lone Wolf or seek out one of the many player-controlled Units and fight under the banners of powerful galactic empires for prestige, wealth, or nothing more than the sheer thrill of battle.  Next Gen Mobility - By the 31st century, tanks have evolved to take on humanoid shape, their treads replaced with nimble legs. Like modern tanks, 'Mechs move their upper torso and weapons independently of their legs offering unparalleled mobility while exchanging fire. Depending on their size, BattleMechs travel at vastly different speeds and offer different systems like jump jets to aid in their locomotion. Make Every Shot Count - Pilots must balance mobility and damage output against the amount of heat generated from their weapons fire and 'Mech operation, lest they risk the temporary loss of power that comes when a 'Mech overheats. Firing all weapons simultaneously (known as an Alpha Strike) can be the quickest way to devastate an opponent, but may leave a 'Mech helpless against its enemies if the heat sinks can't handle the stress. Fight Smart - 'Mechs possess both external armor and strong internal structural elements to help minimize the chance of a 'quick kill'. As a result, pilots must treat each encounter with the utmost attention and awareness, prioritizing weaker or more critical components before delivering the killing blow. Communication among teammates and the effective use of targeting systems can help to identify vulnerable 'Mechs and components. Teamwork is the Difference - Targeting a 'Mech will automatically allow your teammates to achieve their own lock, allowing them to ascertain vital location data, armor status, and loadout details for the targeted enemy. Information Warfare can be a vital component for victory, providing attack-focused allies with the necessary information to tear their opponents to pieces. Information Warfare - While fast-moving scouts feed target and tactical information back to the main battle group and the team commander, long-range Support and heavy-hitting Brawler and Assault ‘Mechs will use this information to position themselves for the perfect strike. Pilots can also shield themselves and allies from enemy sensors and weapons fire using various counter measures. It is up to each pilot to customize their BattleMech loadout to fulfill their desired role.  Find the perfect 'Mech - Hundreds of unique 'Mechs are available, offering a wide range of strengths and weaknesses. Smaller 'Mechs should never stop moving, and can rely on their sheer speed to overwhelm heavier opponents. Larger 'Mechs move slow and deliberate but can stand toe-to-toe with other large opponents. Acquire and test different 'Mechs to find those that best suit your play style. Choose Your Allegiance - Work for the powerful empires of the galaxy to earn their loyalty and spread their influence across the stars. Band together with other pilots using the Looking For Group feature, or use the Faction Chat feature to coordinate offensive and defensive strategies to capture or defend worlds and shift the balance of power. Get Rewarded - Pilots earn ComStar Bills (C-Bills) from playing matches and completing faction contracts, which can be used to purchase new 'Mechs and equipment. Certain items can only be purchased using premium 'Mech Credits (MC). MC can either be purchased directly via real world money or acquired in smaller increments in-game by earning reputation with a Faction in Faction Play, or as rewards from participating in special Events. 'Mech Experience (XP) gained during combat is applied to the 'Mech used during that match, and can be used to unlock improvements to various BattleMech systems. MechWarrior Online™ also includes a host of achievements to unlock that will challenge even the most skilled players.",575824,Piranha Games Inc.,Piranha Games Inc.,GenreAction*GenreFreetoPlay*GenreMassivelyMultiplayer*GenreSimulation*GenreStrategy,TagFreetoPlay*TagMechs*TagAction*TagMultiplayer*TagShooter*TagRobots*TagSimulation*TagSci-fi*TagStrategy*TagFPS*TagMassivelyMultiplayer*TagTactical*TagPvP*TagFirst-Person*TagWalkingSimulator*TagSurvival*TagZombies*TagOpenWorld,50
344760,Reign Of Kings,"Struggle to survive in a harsh medieval world. Hunt wildlife, mine resources, build structures, and craft weapons and armor in order to protect yourself. You may form a guild, bring war to all opposition, and try to seize the throne and become king! In Reign of Kings we allow you to collect resources and craft a wide variety of items needed to build a vast and powerful kingdom. We were primarily inspired by Rust & Chivalry in the development of this game. In addition to standard resources, you may compete over the Ancient Throne which resides in a throne room which overlooks the island. All players who are not part of the King's Guild are taxed on the resources they collect. The development of a melee combat system adds a gritty and visceral feeling to Reign of Kings that will allow players to become deeply immersed in a realistic and intense medieval survival experience. The world itself is designed to inspire competition and struggles for power.  Resource locations strategically spread throughout the game will create inequity and envy.  Players will have the ability to make war, or even capture and hold other players in order to get what they want.  Each player will have the power to decide the fate of the kingdom, or choose to entirely forego the responsibility of ruling the kingdom and roam the land as a freeman.  CAPTURE  Players have the ability to capture, hold, and execute other players. The player can capture them with rope or iron shackles. Once shackled, a player is no longer able to access their inventory aside from their orifice slot. The captured player's inventory is accessible for the captor to search them. Additionally, a rope will be attached to a prisoner which will allow them to be pulled in any direction their captor wishes. In order to avoid severe grieving situations, players can hide a sharp stone or lock pick in their orifice. This ""hidden"" item can help them escape capture or commit suicide. PUNISHMENT & DEATH  Punishment & Death Once the player has control of a captive, there are several options available for managing a prisoner.  Options range from simply locking them in a cage or dungeon, public humiliation in the pillory, or simply executing them. THE ANCIENT THRONE  The Ancient Throne can be claimed by any player. Holding the Ancient Throne will grant its owner dominion over the entire map (change name of realm) and taxation rights over every other player.  The King of the Ancient Throne will receive the ability to collect the resource tax from every player within the game by visiting the Ravens Treasure Tree. The ravens automatically collect taxes in the game (behind the scenes of course, sneaky little things), and place them in the chests in their Treasure Tree.  In addition, the King of the Ancient Throne will have access to the Ancient Sword and the Ancient Crown.  PRODUCTION & REFINING STATIONS  Players will have the ability to collect resources and to craft them into useful items or building materials. Additionally, the progression mechanic for being able to craft higher valued items will be reliant on upgrading production stations to a higher level.  (Need a better quality sword?  Upgrade your anvil.)  Production and refining stations can craft or refine items as long as there are resources available unless ordered to do otherwise.  This allows the player the freedom to do other things while his kingdom remains productive.  COLLECTION STATIONS  Collection stations can be placed for grain and water. Collection stations will passively produce raw materials given they have enough fuel. These collection stations will be fully interactive and if left un-defended will offer a nice target for unscrupulous or enemy players.  With this in mind, the player will want to protect their resources. SIEGE EQUIPMENT AND RAIDING BASES  Once the players build stone walls and iron doors, players will not be able to simply bash their way inside. Players will now need to employ one of many different techniques for entry. The ranged option is to build trebuchets and launch large stones from afar at your opponent's castle. Players must place a counterweight to offset their projectile weight in order to get the range and destruction power they need from the stone they are launching. Players may also rotate the trebuchet. This alignment takes some practice but is very rewarding when set correctly. Players may choose to go a more stealthy route by crafting lock picks. Lock picks, however, are very hard to craft, and do not work on iron doors and iron gates. Players who like it up close and personal may use the explosive keg, which takes a very large amount of resources to craft, and you'll need a few of them to get through multi-layered walls. Players defending a base may employ their own trebuchet or set up a ballista which is great for killing other players at range. FIRST PERSON COMBAT  Our combat systems allow melee and ranged combat to take center stage when war breaks out. Inspired by games like Chivalry, Reign of Kings' combat system is being tuned for satisfying, fast paced action. Players fight over the scarce resources and face off to defend or capture the throne. MELEE  Players equip brutal weapons and use mouse buttons in an attempt to chop, slice, & stab through an opponent. Players will want to upgrade their weaponry to inflict the highest amount of damage as melee combat will always be dangerous and unpredictable.  Armor will be highly prized in Melee as it will keep you in a fight much longer. We support delimbing and decapitation of an opponent to represent the visceral and brutal experience of medieval close-quarters warfare.  A variety of period realistic weapons and armor will be available for the player to craft as they progress toward elder content. RANGED  Ranged fighting in ROK will encompass the use of the bow, crossbow, javelin, and throwing stones. A good way for a player to stay alive in a fight during the early game will be to use ranged weaponry and speed.  Keeping out of sword range from a marauding knight is always a good idea, but even more so if you’re not equipped with the quality of armor that can absorb a hit or two. A simple bow and spear may be capable of taking down wild game, but may not provide enough piercing power to get through the finest plate male.  It’ll be important for the player to learn what kinds of weaponry are most effective in a fight as it will be critical knowledge to stay alive and have impact in a fight.  Higher tier Steel-pointed javelins will be able to pierce some armors, but the crossbow is the best option for punching a hole through the most heavily plated opponent at range.  The general rules of ranged weaponry will apply in ROK to determine functionality.  The bow will have the highest accuracy and reload speed, the crossbow will have greatest piercing power but is slow to reload, and thrown weapons will have the highest damage output, but are for short range use only. LOOT  ROK features a plague-ridden village that was cursed and abandoned by the old gods. This village features plague-ridden villagers, loot crates, and some high-end loot drops. It is dangerous to be in the village for long periods of time due to the disease that will damage the player's health. DEATH  ROK uses a roguelike death model similar to Rust.  When players die, they will fall to the ground as a ragdoll container that can be looted by other players.  Dead players will be provided with a random re-spawn option that can be improved through bed placement. CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION  Players begin the game by creating a unique character.  They will be able to refine their look in great detail by editing their body parts, choosing hair, and establishing a banner scheme to help them identify loyal friends during gameplay. You can also choose the voice style of your player's taunts. BUILDING  Using the standard block, ramp and stairs, ROK building materials will consist of sticks, thatch, clay, wood, re-enforced wood, and stone.  Thatch, sticks, wood and clay will be widely available and often the first choice in material for beginning level housing. While these materials will offer shelter from poorly equipped enemies, they are easily breached by other players. Stone will offer much greater resistance to basic attacks and will only be damageable with siege tactics.  Players will be able to build their homes, towers and castles any way they like, but will need a great deal of space during elder content play in order to hold a large number of production, refining, and collection stations. Building castles will be a natural occurrence for players who reach elder content gameplay.  With the large number of production stations, refining stations, collection stations, chests, torture devices and respawn beds available for the player to build, comes the need to protect a large footprint of space.",420439,Code}{atch,Code}{atch,GenreAction*GenreAdventure*GenreIndie*GenreRPG*GenreSimulation,TagSurvival*TagOpenWorld*TagMultiplayer*TagMedieval*TagCrafting*TagBuilding*TagPvP*TagSandbox*TagAction*TagAdventure*TagRPG*TagOnlineCo-Op*TagRealistic*TagGore*TagSimulation*TagCo-op*TagIndie*TagDarkFantasy*TagDarkHumor*TagFPS,23

Ultimately, you must conquer every Kingdom by crippling their castles and killing their men and livestock, in as creative or clinical a manner as possible!",1494589,Spiderling Studios,Spiderling Studios,GenreIndie*GenreSimulation*GenreEarlyAccess,TagEarlyAccess*TagBuilding*TagSandbox*TagPhysics*TagDestruction*TagMedieval*TagSingleplayer*TagSimulation*TagStrategy*TagIndie*TagFunny*TagPuzzle*TagBlood*TagAction*TagCasual*TagThirdPerson*TagGore*TagOpenWorld*TagAdventure*TagDifficult,96
346110,ARK: Survival Evolved,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame & breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! The following features are in the game on its Day-1 Early Access release. We have many more aspects and refinements planned for the long-term development roadmap, and here's what you get to experience right now in ARK:   Dinosaurs, Creatures, & Breeding! -- over 50+ at Early Access start and 100+ planned for final release -- can be tamed using a challenging capture-&-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger pets can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Pets can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!   You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!    By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.   Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner!   By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of pets, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.   Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your Pets can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village!   All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your Pets, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers.   Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have pets to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous pets!   The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct & draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray...  And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned.   On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items!   You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!   The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Will you settle for bows and arrows and a campfire, or push deeper into the map and start scavenging for vehicle parts and better weapons? Built from the ground up with solid multiplayer foundations. Designed for fast skill based PVP and PVE. You will constantly have to decide which is the biggest threat, the player opposite you or the creatures that will hear your gunshot.Current Features  Crafting Gear, Tools, Weapons and Machines - Combine what you find in the world to make hundreds of different items.Structure Building - Claim land solo or with friends, build from a hut to a city using our attachment point based structure system.Procedurally Generated, Customizable Vehicles - Find a car or quad bike wreck in world with random panels. Scavenge for parts and get it moving again. Find rare paint colors and skin patterns to get it looking just the way you want. Upgrade your engine and gearbox. Make sure to carry a spare tire!Mining Resources - Heaps of different minable resources that require different tools to gather, from Pickaxes to Dynamite. Alternatively you can build some automated drills and let them do the work for you.Twitch based PVP - Some areas of the map will be highly contested, are you willing to share the limited resources needed to survive? If you aren't, we have many different projectile and melee weapons to do away with your opponent. Careful though, murdering your peers may increase your own penalty for death.Farmable Plants - Find wild seeds and get a crop going back home.Hunting Neutral and Hostile Animals - Environment is filled with animals, they may be your lunch, you may be theirs.Town Ruins and Relics with Random Loot - Tightly contested, if the radiation and mutated creatures don't kill you, another player will. You might just find those engine parts you've been looking for here.Dynamic Day/Night + Weather - Pick the right time of day to attempt crossing sand dunes, but watch out for sandstorms.Stat Simulation - More than just a hunger bar, everything in the world is affected by time of day, current biome, localized effects like radiation, dynamic weather, heat given off by machines etc. Items can have different behaviors based on current stats too. That steak in your backpack might just freeze in the snow, at least it will take longer to go rotten. Put that storage chest too close to your fire you may come home to a pile of Ash.Drastically Different Biomes - Explore the harsh world. From the snow forests of the North to the colorful parrot Tokars of the red desert, gear that lets you survive in one biome may kill you in another. Players with a home base advantage will likely be better equipped to handle their surroundings than invaders. All the features above are currently in the game and functional, however much of the content in these systems is placeholder. While we've done a lot of the hard work developing robust systems to underpin gameplay mechanics, we haven't yet spent a lot of time generating and balancing content for these systems. As this is mostly configuration work, we will be able to quickly deliver lots of new content in the coming months.Server Authoritative MultiplayerMost multiplayer open world games use a MMO style network architecture. While this allows for greater player numbers per server, it opens up the game up to endless cheating exploits that are impossible to stomp out. Hurtworld uses an architecture closer to that of a modern FPS, where all physics and game logic are calculated on the server. While cheats can never be fully stopped, this structure makes a large amount of the exploits impossible from day one. Due to this, our servers will use a bit more resources for the same number of people than your usual survival game, but we think it's totally worth it.PerformanceKeeping your FPS high and smooth is crucially important to us. As members of the PC master race we know 60+ FPS is a right, not a privilege. Not to mention PVP gunplay just doesn't work at low FPS. This is an ongoing battle while we are developing the game, adding new stuff slows things down, doing an optimization pass gives us some breathing room. It goes in cycles.   Currently things are running very well, we did a lot of hard work during our closed alpha to bring performance up and to get rid of big spikes. On mid range 2 year old machines we're currently getting 80+ FPS on medium settings. Our biggest bottleneck is player skinning on the CPU. Meaning if your CPU is a potato, and there are lots of players in your area, it will chugg. We have a fairly comprehensive graphical settings menu that should let you scale things down even on lower spec machines. We are constantly working to improve performance and we'll do our best to keep everything running well throughout early access.PVP & GunplayHurtworld has competitive FPS in its DNA. Violence isn't the only option, but when it's needed you want to be sure it's a fair skill rewarding system. We are keeping the gear cap low on PVP items. This means a player with 150 hours in a server and endgame loot can't faceroll their way around the map with impunity. Higher grade gear will allow you to survive in harsher environments and take on fiercer creatures, it won't however stop a bullet to the face.Infamy SystemWe are currently testing a new system that changes the way gear is dropped on death. By default all gear you have equipped like tools guns and clothes won't drop on death.  Secured gear in your hotbar and equipment slots (gear you are wearing) can only be dropped if your infamy level is above zero. Infamy is a stat bar that increases by one every time you kill someone, and slowly decreases over time back to zero. For each point of infamy you currently have, you have a chance to lose a secured item (equipped gear / weapons / tools). We hope this will have a few effects.  Most people will actually use their best gear all the timeNew spawns being harassed at spawn that can’t fight back won’t lose muchPlayers harassing fresh spawns are putting a target on their own head, as some of their gear is now up for grabs to anyone who kills them, creating interesting skirmishes.Farming yield of a player will be dependant on the territory they can control. If a player tries to mine the limited resources around your base, you can kill them to claim the resources back without completely ruining their day.We can make tiers of gear much more expensive to create without crossing the too valuable to lose bracket As with any new gameplay system, it sounds great in theory to us, how it plays will be the real test. This behavior is currently enabled by default, however server owners can override playerlootmode to 4 different settings depending on preference including the classic lose everything.Modding Modding is one of our top priorities. We have been working with the awesome guys at Oxide, to integrate their modding framework with Hurtworld. You can download their API right now and start writing server mods for Hurtworld in Lua, C#, Javascript or Python! In the future we want to build Hurtworld into a platform for different sandbox game types (Think Dota 2 custom games). We are designing the game we want to play most, however the framework of player movement, gear, combat, environmental effects, AI, vehicles, construction and gathering can all be applied to vastly different game modes with very little work. We are slowly building up a more powerful SDK we plan to release sometime in 2016. I can't wait to see what other people do with a solid FPS framework with the backing of a fleshed out survival game.FAQ Will you add procedural maps?Currently we are focusing on hand crafted maps. We are a good way through developing an SDK for Unity we call ""Shigi Tools"" designed to allow the community to create their own maps in-engine. It's not out of the realm of possibility that a server will have its own unique map designed by its admins that is downloaded on connection. This combined with server side mods should open up the gameplay possibilities a lot. We don't have an ETA on this yet, we are using it to build internal maps but it will require some new engine systems to handle runtime loading that we will prioritize amongst other things. Can I host a server?Yes! We have a Windows and Linux headless server build that can be downloaded through the tools section of Steam or via SteamCMD, check out the Hurtworld Wiki for guides. How many players per server?We are optimizing for 50. We run all our physics on the server with low jitter and a high tickrate. This means we won't reach the 200+ mmo class of servers, however we think the tradeoff is worth it for a more responsive experience and a game more resistant to cheats. It also means we can do more interesting things with AI that feel more like Left for Dead and less like World of Warcraft. MAC USERS NOTE: If you get a crash on startup of the game, please disable Steam overlay",275604,Bankroll Studios,Bankroll Studios,GenreAction*GenreAdventure*GenreSimulation*GenreEarlyAccess,TagEarlyAccess*TagSurvival*TagOpenWorld*TagMultiplayer*TagCrafting*TagBuilding*TagAdventure*TagPvP*TagAction*TagSandbox*TagFirst-Person*TagFPS*TagSimulation*TagThirdPerson*TagCo-op*TagShooter*TagIndie*TagPvE*TagSingleplayer*TagCartoony,52

The galaxy contains hundreds of star systems and planets, and several alien species with their own unique technologies. You can choose between more than fifty ships and several hundred ship upgrades. A plugin system allows anyone with a text editor and a paint program to create new ships, weapons, or missions, and the galaxy editor can be used to add new star systems and planets.  Endless Sky is free, open source, and cross platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
